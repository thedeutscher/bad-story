In a flashback, a young Jill is sobbing in bed as her mother Amelia tries to comfort her. Jill is angry with her parents for making her older sister Lana leave. Amelia says that they had to do that because of what Lana did and that as a parent you have to set boundaries. Amelia leaves as Jill hears small pebbles being thrown at her window and she opens it to see Lana outside. Lana sneaks up to her room and they hug and talk. Lana is concerned for her young sister whom she affectionately calls "Jillybean". She says she has to leave for a long time and Jill says she will miss her. Lana reminds her that whenever she's missing her, she should look to the moon, knowing that wherever she is, Lana will also be looking at it. Back a the present, Jill looks at a photo of her as a kid on Lana's shoulders, with the caption "Look at the moon" as it is seen that Jill is wearing Lana's beanie. Along with the photo of Lana is also a photo of Bella. Jill gets back to her laptop where she exchanges messages with someone called Jonathan about starting a campaign in Lana's honor.

Maya, Josy, and the protagonist walk back to Maya's dorm as Maya finds the door unlocked. They almost get caught entering together by Maya's father Patrick who is waiting in the dorm but the protagonist quickly yanks Josy away and sends her off to hide in his room at the DIK mansion. Patrick starts interrogating Maya as the protagonist enters and saves the situation by making up a story about him being her roommate. After Patrick leaves they discuss their options and they agree that the best option is that Maya will for now be alone in her dorm and Josy will move into the HOT house. The protagonist goes back to the mansion and finds Derek being painted by Jacob, as Derek privately tells him that Josy is in his room. 

The next morning Quinn updates a still sick Sage about the fallout at the HOT ceremony yesterday, revealing that after Maya and Josy left Mona also ran away and mocks Maya and the other leavers. Quinn hides the real reason they left and seems content with not having to care for them as Sage tells her that she must give them another chance and go tell them that the HOTs want them to rejoin and that it is expected from her to act this way if she ever wants to become president.

In the DIK house, the DIKs get ready to do the walk of shame but stop when they see Josy exiting the protagonist's room and decide to hide it from Tommy because he will be furious if he finds out. The protagonist starts using his new phone and is surprised to see it has many contacts on it already, to which Rusty replies by revealing that they bought all these phones in bulk, that they are all synchronized to their cloud account, and that someone might have used the phone before it was given to the protagonist. On social media, it is seen that Dawe is scratching his groin (having caught crabs from Arieth) and when Derek reveals that Jacob is painting him, John Boy and Elena reveal that they have asked Jacob to paint them having sex but were declined.

Tybalt tries to persuade Jill to schedule their first date but Jill tries to brush him off and calls Bella for help with the situation. The DIKs start hauling trash and broken furniture from the mansion now that the dumpster they rented has arrived. John Boy remarks that some of the trash was on the other side of the yard even though they agreed to pile it all in one place. Tommy reveals he had sex with Tania yesterday and that he and Heather are in an open relationship, however, he was supposed to ask Heather before having sex with Tania and didn't so he's trying to keep it a secret. It is revealed that the last time he did that, Nick told Heather about it when he was drunk. Tommy also reveals that he got a job for them cleaning at The Pink Rose and they decide to split the DIKs between working there and at the elderly home. Tommy reveals that the pay from the job he got them is significantly lower than from the elderly home but the DIKs are still enthusiastic about working there.

Josy takes her stuff from Maya's dorm revealing that she agreed to join the HOTs after all. As she walks out Quinn walks in and tells Maya that Sage forced her to offer her another chance, as Maya declines again and Quinn is not surprised with the outcome, flipping Maya off as she walks away. The new HOTs wear their uniforms.

At Bella's house, Jill reveals to her that Tybalt is blackmailing her and requires her to stop seeing the protagonist as well as go with him on three dates, otherwise he will file a complaint against the protagonist. Bella has a feeling that Tybalt is lying and tells Jill she has to stand up against his threats but ultimately agrees to help Jill sabotage the dates she already agreed to have with him.

The protagonist signs the paperwork for officially leaving his old dorm with Troy as he is joined by Derek and Jamie is seen hanging out with Riona. Derek and the protagonist discuss Derek's failed attempts at getting back with Ashley. In class, the protagonist realizes that Cathy is skipping ahead in the curriculum. After class, Cathy reveals to the protagonist that the flyers of her leaked photos everywhere on campus have broken her and that she's going to quit and move to a different college. She asks him to tell Rusty that it's not his fault and they make out. Outside the classroom, Jill lets the protagonist know that they should avoid meeting each other for now until she sorts out the issue with Tybalt.

Back in the DIK mansion, Tommy readies the DIKs to go to work at The Pink Rose and when Leon asks him about how they get paid, Tommy tells him to not worry about that and that he will be handling the money. In his room, the protagonist meets a now recovered Sage, who comes to thank him for supporting her after the breakup and asks to practice sparring to take her remaining anger out, as Jacob overhears them exercising and is worried they are fighting. Sage tries to make out with the protagonist and he denies her, saying he doesn't want to be her rebound guy and risk his chance at having something more with her. Sage leaves with mixed feelings. 

The DIKs go to work at The Pink Rose and are disappointed when they realize that they're cleaning before the evening starts, so none of the strippers are there. Jamie is sad thinking about Dany and Leon cheers him up by making fun of the protagonist cleaning the cage (that he danced naked in on their first night in The Pink Rose). After they finish cleaning, the club opens and the protagonist and Leon go to the VIP room, revealing that Leon also won Hell Week back when he was a maggot. Leon meets Tania and goes off with her, and the protagonist meets a stripper called Madame Rose. After they're done, Leon reveals that his VIP pass is about to end, and jokingly asks the protagonist if he wants to sell him his pass.

Riona and Camila discuss Mona having dropped out of college as they are being watched. Camila reveals that she's trying to contact Mona but the latter isn't answering her calls, as Riona advises her to let Mona be. At the library, the protagonist starts working as Bella's assistant and Bella flirts with him, as Maya is studying and Sage and Bella are working on her dissertation. Sage talks with Maya about rejoining the HOTs and is unhappy when she hears what Quinn did to her. Maya tells her she needs that free tuition but won't tell her the reason. Sage leaves saying she hasn't given up on her and is going to continue trying to get her to rejoin. Maya reveals to the protagonist that she went home last weekend and she thinks she and Derek managed to convince Patrick that she's living in a single dorm now.

Bella crashes Jill's first date with Tybalt at the mall. While Tybalt is off to purchase a new suit, Bella and Jill discuss Sage and Bella says she was positively surprised with her, having expected her to be spoiled and childish. Jill reveals that she tried to open up to Sage once but Sage didn't want to talk with her.

On social media, Tybalt advertises his first date with Jill to her dismay, and talks about his upcoming presentation for economics students about welfare as he is mocked by Tyballs. 

The protagonist hangs out with Josy at the HOT house. She reveals that she's sharing a room with Heather, who thinks the protagonist is a creep, and they go to the HOT swimming pool where they join Lily and Ashley. They discuss women having multiple sets of swimsuits as Lily reveals to the protagonist that there is a party on Saturday and Ashley says she heard that the DIKs are not going to come because of the feud between Tommy and Quinn. The protagonist criticizes the HOTs for not following their code due to what they did to Maya, as Josy agrees and Lily tells him that Mona also left, which Josy whispers is due to some trouble with the free tuition arrangement. Ashley says they've been trying to contact Mona but she isn't responding, as she and Lily leave the pool. The protagonist asks Josy about her friendship with Jill as Josy also inquires about the nature of his relationship with Jill. Josy propositions him to join the gym with her, and they discuss the inheritance money he received.

The protagonist brings Maya an old TV from the DIK mansion that is slightly cracked but still working. The protagonist lets Maya know of his mother's diary that he got and suggests watching "Wings of a Butterfly" which turns out to be a terrible movie. They discuss Maya's relationship with Josy and the HOTs and she tells him about how they faked the last scavenger hunt tasks and showed it only to Arieth, that she slapped Quinn, and that Quinn was evil to her and gave her tasks that were much more difficult than the others got.

The protagonist hangs out with Quinn in her room. They smoke and when he asks Quinn what is she studying at college, she is reluctant to answer that and asks him to drop the subject. Â 

Quinn talks with Arieth and tries to obtain evidence that Maya didn't complete her scavenger hunt tasks. Lily confronts Quinn about wanting to buy drugs from her for herself and the girls at The Pink Rose, for a large sum of money, as Quinn lowers her guard and they go to talk in private.

The narrator talks about him having been tempted to buy a gym membership using some of the money he got, and that he saved most of it, not knowing what he was saving for at the time. He also notes that the threesome with Quinn and Riona cost him $500 which he covered later using that money. The narrator continues, discussing the days after Hell Week being relatively dull, with the DIKs mostly working on fixing the mansion, as the story skips to Saturday. Derek and Leon try to get drunk by putting vodka-soaked tampons in their ass and Jacob and the protagonist decide to take a break and go out to the party at the HOT house, who are now partying with the jocks again.

The DIKs' presence at the party stirs up anger but they avoid entering any fights. Anthony rejects Arieth, letting her know that he's with Ashley now. Camila, Josy, and Lily discuss the HOT uniforms being too revealing, as Heather joins the discussion and reveals that the old uniforms were much worse. Quinn also joins and mocks Heather for complaining about her big breasts again, and then takes Heather to the side to discuss something in private. Josy is feeling uncomfortable being around Sage and Heather who are much taller than her.

The protagonist calls Derek who is now drunk from the vodka tampons and asks him about the dorm girls that are attending the party, and Derek tells him that he is interested in a few of them: Kylie, Clara, and Penny. The protagonist meets Penny and Kylie and Penny reveals that she likes Derek, and the protagonist lets her know that Derek also likes her. Jacob wants to hit on Clara but is scared of hanging around the jocks. Caleb and Darius discuss Arieth as Caleb reveals that he has been trying to brush her off ever since they hooked up at the Hell Week party. The protagonist lets Arieth know that Caleb is in the kitchen, and Arieth goes to find him, which gets Caleb and Darius to run away from the party.

Tri-Alpha member Jimmy is very drunk and tries to hit on Lily and the protagonist helps get rid of him. Lily appreciates the help, telling the protagonist that he has balls, and takes him to her room where she discusses her impression of him. She tells the protagonist that she couldn't figure him out before, that he seems like a party person, and that he's going to be dangerous, and that's the type she's looking for, not right now but eventually. The protagonist is puzzled and Lily has sex with him and then inquires him about his relationship status and thinks about them "rolling", which she explains is being together not as a couple but more for status and influence.

Dawe is hurt by Anthony spending time with Ashley now instead of with him, as he reveals that they liked going together to the lake to watch the swans, and goes to sit alone in the pool area. Sage gets to know Josy and is told about Josy's history with the protagonist. The protagonist talks with Josy when she reveals to him that she's self-conscious about being short. When he goes to bring Josy a drink, he comes back to Tri-Alpha member John hitting on her and pretends to be her boyfriend to get him off of her. They discuss their time working together at the mini-mart and dance.

Quinn is selling drugs to Sally and Karen. The protagonist and Ashley talk about Derek and she wants him to let Derek know that she isn't angry with him anymore. The protagonist tells Derek about it, who drunkenly writes an emotional message to Ashley that makes her cry and leave the party. The protagonist asks Derek what did he write to Ashley but Derek doesn't remember.

The protagonist talks with Heather who suspects something is up with Tommy and he lets her know that Tommy cheated on her.

It is revealed that Riona has an obsession with keeping her furniture properly aligned and that she never orgasms during sex. Sage promises the protagonist that he's not just a rebound guy and that she's okay with exploring a deeper relationship with him. Quinn and Riona walk in on them having sex. Sage asks the protagonist to plan the Halloween party with her and Quinn.

Chad and Alex are in Melanie's room with her and discuss Chad's breakup with Sage and that Sage doesn't know he's here. Alex sees the protagonist and wants to start a fight but Chad calms him down. Lily and Sage discuss why Chad is at the party and Sage says she didn't invite him. Sarah overhears the protagonist talking about Sage having noticed he's there and tips Camila off who gets Chad to leave. John Boy also arrives at the party wanting to hang out with Elena, and Jacob goes to hit on Clara now that the alphas are gone.

The next morning the DIKs do the walk of shame ritual as Clara leaves Jacob's room and Ashley leaves Derek's room. They almost accidentally reveal to Tommy that Josy left the protagonist's room in a previous walk of shame but manage to salvage it. Bella calls the protagonist and asks him for help crashing Jill's second date with Tybalt at the tennis court. In the showers, the protagonist and Tybalt exchange insults and Tybalt reveals that he wasn't born rich, claiming that he also came from poverty but has managed to climb up. On the way back, Bella confronts the protagonist about her having found Cathy's underwear in her car and lectures him about having to choose between the women he's dating before he hurts someone. In Bella's house, they agree to take their relationship slow and go out on a date.

The protagonist lies in his bed thinking about the situation with Jill and the other girls he is dating. He decides to sneak into Jill's room to meet her. He throws pebbles at her window and then climbs up, reminding her of how Lana used to do that. Jill tells the protagonist about Lana and reveals that Lana didn't stand up to the standards of the Royce family and that's why they kicked her out. Jill reveals that she's a virgin and says that she's not yet ready to have sex. After the protagonist leaves, Jill is angry with herself for not having been able to confront her fear of sex or tell the protagonist that she wants him, as she touches herself thinking about having sex with him.

The protagonist reads another page of Lynette's diary. After her plan of running away didn't work out, she ended up moving with her father far away as was planned. The house they've moved to is an old hotel and her father hired Neil's construction crew to renovate it. One of the workers notices that the building doesn't match the plans, meaning that someone has been building illegally, causing the start of the construction to be delayed. Neil and his coworker Luis see Lynette through the hotel's windows, and Luis is sad that he's married and can't hit on her. When talking privately with the supervisor, Neil takes praise for noticing the mismatch in the construction plans. 

Back at the present, Neil comes to visit the protagonist and brings the DIKs a bunch of used furniture in excellent condition from a hotel they are now rebuilding. He also offers them an arrangement with his coworker Luis to build new windows for them. Riona asks the protagonist to protect her because of her feelings of being stalked. Sage inquires the protagonist for information on Maya. It is revealed that Jamie maintains a garden at the DIK's house, which he has been hiding by using the DIK's secret code, and that he wants to be a botanist like his mom. It is also revealed that Derek turned his room into a bar, called the Moose Lounge after the moose he stole from Tybalt that he hung on the wall. Tommy is leaving his room as two unidentified girls are sleeping in his bed. John Boy cooks breakfast for everybody and the DIKs sit down to eat and talk about what's new with everyone. Tommy reveals that he had sex with Tania again but then remembers that he already said that. The DIKs discuss Cathy leaving the school and the protagonist tells Rusty what she told him about it not being his fault.

The protagonist and Jill go for a run, then take a dip in the lake and make out. In the school's staff room, people discuss Cathy leaving the school as Jade seems to not care and is even mildly satisfied. In gender studies class, Sarah and Ashley talk with Maya and send regards from the HOTs as Wendy talks with the protagonist and complains about Derek. Jade texts the protagonist and sends him nude photos of her.

Tybalt gives his lecture on welfare as the protagonist's dick picture appears in his slideshow. In the audience, Josy and Jill are sitting together and Josy recognizes the dick as belonging to the protagonist, to which Jill reacts worryingly. In a nearby seat, Sage also recognizes the protagonist's dick as the worry on Jill's face intensifies. Jill and Josy talk in private in the bathroom as Jill sobs and confesses to Josy that she has feelings for the protagonist and that she feels bad about him dating other women.

In Quinn's room, Tommy tells Quinn he's out of drugs as he has been waiting for Quinn to apologize. Quinn refuses to apologize and tells him that her prices have doubled. Tommy refuses to buy and is about to walk out but Quinn stops him and tries to continue talking. She tells him that she had no choice but to take the ANO party deal and Tommy tells her that the issue was in not letting the DIKs know. He blames her for ruining their hell week tradition but Quinn refuses to take the blame, mocking Tommy for blaming her for this and the assault on their mansion, as Tommy apologizes for blaming her for what happened to the mansion. Quinn still refuses to apologize.

The protagonist joins the gym with Josy as the narrator enters a monologue about being yourself. He notes that going to the gym was a large change for him as it suddenly made him feel normal and that being yourself is difficult which is why people hide their true selves, as the scene cuts to Jamie in his flower garden, Bella removing her wedding ring, Quinn looking at the bag of cocaine, Karen touching her hearing aid, and finally Maya and Sage in Maya's dorm.

Maya thanks Sage for trusting her by revealing so much about herself, as Sage asks Maya to also tell her about her situation. Sage says she has always wanted to one day help someone with something big, and that this might be an opportunity to do that. Maya agrees and begins telling her story. The narrator continues explaining the difficulty of showing people your true self, and Maya tears up as she continues her story. The scene cuts to Bella removing her wedding ring, Rusty bringing flowers to Cathy and tearing up as they hug, and Derek talking with Ashley.

The narrator explains that in revealing your true self you might find a lot of gain, as Sage concludes her talk with Maya saying she has a plan that might work. She leaves the HOT uniform in Maya's room. The narrator then explains that in revealing your true self there is also a lot to lose, as the protagonist enters the gym's locker room, and sees Chad and Troy kissing.
