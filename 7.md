In a flashback, a young Jill is sobbing in bed as her mother Amelia tries to comfort her. Jill is angry with her parents for making her older sister Lana leave. Amelia says that they had to do that because of what Lana did and that as a parent you have to set boundaries. Amelia leaves as Jill hears small pebbles being thrown at her window and she opens it to see Lana outside. Lana sneaks up to her room and they hug and talk. Lana is concerned for her young sister whom she affectionately calls "Jillybean". She says she has to leave for a long time and Jill says she will miss her. Lana reminds her that whenever she's missing her, she should look to the moon, knowing that wherever she is, Lana will also be looking at it. Back a the present, Jill looks at a photo of her as a kid on Lana's shoulders, with the caption "Look at the moon" as it is seen that Jill is wearing Lana's beanie. Along with the photo of Lana is also a photo of Bella. Jill gets back to her laptop where she exchanges messages with someone called Jonathan about starting a campaign in Lana's honor.

Maya, Josy, and the protagonist walk back to Maya's dorm as Maya finds the door unlocked. They almost get caught entering together by Maya's father Patrick who is waiting in the dorm but the protagonist quickly yanks Josy away and sends her off to hide in his room at the DIK mansion. Patrick starts interrogating Maya as the protagonist enters and saves the situation by making up a story about him being her roommate. After Patrick leaves they discuss their options and they agree that Maya will for now be alone in her dorm as Josy moves into the HOT house.

The next morning Quinn updates a still sick Sage about the fallout at the HOT ceremony yesterday, revealing that after Maya and Josy left Mona also ran away and mocks Maya and the other leavers. Quinn hides the real reason they left and seems content with not having to care for them as Sage tells her that she must give them another chance and go tell them that the HOTs want them to rejoin and that it is expected from her to act this way if she ever wants to become president.

In the DIK house, Josy leaves and the DIKs start working on fixing the mansion. Tommy reveals he had sex with Tania yesterday and that he and Heather are in an open relationship, however, he was supposed to ask Heather before having sex with Tania and didn't so he's trying to keep it a secret. Tommy also reveals that he got a job for them cleaning at The Pink Rose, as they decide to split the DIKs between working there and at the elderly home.

Josy takes her stuff from Maya's dorm revealing that she agreed to join the HOTs after all. As she walks out Quinn walks in and tells Maya that Sage forced her to offer her another chance, as Maya declines again and Quinn is not surprised with the outcome, flipping Maya off as she walks away. The new HOTs wear their uniforms.

At Bella's house, Jill reveals to her that Tybalt is blackmailing her and requires her to stop seeing the protagonist as well as go with him on three dates. Bella tells Jill she has to stand up against his threats but ultimately agrees to help Jill sabotage the dates she already agreed to have with him.

The protagonist signs the paperwork for officially leaving his old dorm with Troy as he and Derek discuss Derek's failed attempts at getting back with Ashley. After class, Cathy reveals to the protagonist that the flyers of her leaked photos everywhere on campus have broken her and that she's going to quit and move to a different college. She asks him to tell Rusty that it's not his fault.

In his room in the DIK house, the protagonist meets a now recovered Sage, who comes to thank him for supporting her after the breakup and asks to practice sparring to take her remaining anger out. Sage tries to make out with him and he denies her, saying he doesn't want to be her rebound guy and risk his chance at having something more with her.

Riona and Camila discuss what happened with Mona as they are being watched. At the library, the protagonist starts working as Bella's assistant as Maya is studying and Sage and Bella are working on her dissertation.

Sage leaves saying she hasn't given up on her and is going to continue trying to get her to rejoin. Bella crashes Jill's first date with Tybalt at the mall. Bella and Jill discuss Sage and Bella says she was positively surprised with her, having expected her to be spoiled and childish.

At the HOT house, Lily reveals to the protagonist that there is a party on Saturday and Ashley says she heard that the DIKs are not going to come because of the feud between Tommy and Quinn. They also tell him that Mona left due to some trouble with the free tuition arrangement.

Quinn talks with Arieth and tries to obtain evidence that Maya didn't complete her scavenger hunt tasks. Lily confronts Quinn about wanting to buy drugs from her for herself and the girls at The Pink Rose, for a large sum of money, as Quinn lowers her guard and they go to talk in private.

The narrator talks about the days after hell week being relatively dull, with the DIKs mostly working on fixing the mansion, as the story skips to Saturday when Jacob and the protagonist decide to take a break and go out to the party at the HOT house, who are now partying with the jocks again. Their presence at the party stirs up a lot of anger but they avoid entering any fights. Sage gets to know Josy and is told about Josy's history with the protagonist. Quinn is selling Xanax to Sally and Karen. It is revealed that Riona has an obsession with keeping her furniture properly aligned. Sage promises the protagonist that he's not just a rebound guy and that she's okay with exploring a deeper relationship with him. Quinn and Riona walk in on them having sex. Sage asks the protagonist to plan the Halloween party with her and Quinn. At the upper floor, Chad is seen with Melanie. Lily and Sage discuss why Chad is there and Sage says she didn't invite him. Sarah overhears the protagonist talking about Sage having noticed he's there and tips Camila off who gets Chad to leave. A drunk Derek writes an emotional message to Ashley and gets her to leave the party and come to be with him at the DIK house.

The next morning the DIKs do the walk of shame ritual as Ashley leaves Derek's room. Bella calls the protagonist and asks him for help crashing Jill's second date with Tybalt at the tennis court. In the showers, the protagonist and Tybalt exchange insults and Tybalt reveals that he wasn't born rich and also came from poverty. On the way back, Bella confronts the protagonist with her having found Cathy's underwear in her car. In Bella's house, they agree to take their relationship slow and go out on a date.

The protagonist sneaks into Jill's house to meet her. He throws pebbles at her window and then climbs up, reminding her of how Lana used to do that. Jill tells the protagonist about Lana and reveals that Lana didn't stand up to the standards of the Royce family and that's why they kicked her out. Jill reveals that she's a virgin and says that she's not yet ready to have sex. After the protagonist leaves, Jill is angry with herself for not having been able to confront her fear of sex or tell the protagonist that she wants him, as she touches herself thinking about having sex with him.

The protagonist reads another page of Lynette's diary. After her plan of running away didn't work out, she ended up moving with her father far away as was planned. The house they've moved to is an old hotel and her father hired Neil's construction crew to renovate it.

Back at the present, Neil comes to visit the protagonist and brings the DIKs a bunch of furniture from a hotel they are now rebuilding. He also offers them an arrangement with his coworker Luis to build new windows for them. Riona asks the protagonist to protect her because of her feelings of being stalked. Sage inquires the protagonist for information on Maya. It is revealed that Jamie maintains a garden at the DIK's house, which he has been hiding by using the DIK's secret code. It is also revealed that Derek turned his room into a bar, called the Moose Lounge after the moose he stole from Tybalt that he hung on the wall. The DIKs discuss Cathy leaving the school and the protagonist tells Rusty what she told him about it not being his fault.

The protagonist and Jill go for a run and make out. In the school's staff room, people discuss Cathy leaving the school as Jade seems to not care and is even mildly satisfied. Tybalt gives a lecture as the protagonist's dick picture appears in his slideshow. In the audience, Josy and Jill are sitting together and Josy recognizes the dick as belonging to the protagonist, to which Jill reacts worryingly. In a nearby seat, Sage also recognizes the protagonist's dick as the worry on Jill's face intensifies. Jill and Josy talk in private in the bathroom as Jill sobs and confesses to Josy that she has feelings for the protagonist and that she feels bad about him dating other women.

In Quinn's room, Tommy tells Quinn he's out of drugs as he has been waiting for Quinn to apologize. Quinn refuses to apologize and tells him that her prices have doubled. Tommy refuses to buy and is about to walk out but Quinn stops him and tries to continue talking. She tells him that she had no choice but to take the ANO party deal and Tommy tells her that the issue was in not letting the DIKs know. He blames her for ruining their hell week tradition but Quinn refuses to take the blame, mocking Tommy for blaming her for this and the assault on their mansion, as Tommy apologizes for blaming her for what happened to the mansion. Quinn still refuses to apologize.

The protagonist joins the gym with Josy as the narrator enters a monologue about being yourself. He notes that going to the gym was a large change for him as it suddenly made him feel normal and that being yourself is difficult which is why people hide their true selves, as the scene cuts to Jamie in his flower garden, Bella looking at her wedding ring, Quinn looking at the bag of cocaine, Karen touching her hearing aid, and finally Maya and Sage in Maya's dorm.

Maya thanks Sage for trusting her by revealing so much about herself, as Sage asks Maya to also tell her about her situation. Sage says she has always wanted to one day help someone with something big, and that this might be an opportunity to do that. Maya agrees and begins telling her story. The narrator continues explaining the difficulty of showing people your true self, and Maya tears up as she continues her story. The scene cuts to Bella removing her wedding ring, and Rusty bringing flowers to Cathy and tearing up as they hug.

The narrator explains that in revealing your true self you might find a lot of gain, as Sage concludes her talk with Maya saying she has a plan that might work. She leaves the HOT uniform in Maya's room. The narrator then explains that in revealing your true self there is also a lot to lose, as the protagonist enters the gym's locker room, and sees Chad and Troy kissing.
