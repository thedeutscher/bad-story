title: Episode 9 - Vixens
---

A flashback or flash forward shows Christmas at Bella's house, with a tidied-up Christmas table. As the camera pans out, it is apparent that something bad happened, as a part of the table is wrecked and there's a mess on the floor. A figure stands at the entrance to Bella's mysterious room.

The DIK mansion is fully decorated for Halloween, as people start arriving and the party gets going. The protagonist takes care of some last-minute problems that arise due to Tommy's carelessness and then sits down for a beer with Derek, as they recall and discuss recent events. The story jumps back to the moment he stepped into the Burke's house at the end of episode 8.

The protagonist is shocked to see the family photos on the counter and asks Maya and Josy if they knew that Sage is a Burke, to which Maya replies casually that Sage usually goes by "Sage Morgan Burke" but generally yes. Sage introduces the group to her family. Jade is surprised and Tybalt is angry to see the protagonist. The protagonist talks with Josy and makes sure her name is "Josephine Taylor" and that she doesn't have any additional last names. Sage and Maya go to talk with Stephen as the protagonist excuses himself to the bathroom.

The talk with Stephen begins alright, and he asks Sage to leave the room to hear more from Maya. He is initially inclined to apply Maya to a scholarship but when she mentions the rumors about the HOT sorority providing free tuition, and that she ended up joining it anyway after being persuaded by Sage, Stephen turns around and tells her that his hands are tied and he can't help her, as he deletes the filled application from his computer. In the bathroom, the protagonist talks with Neil on the phone and it is revealed that Neil didn't tell Zoey the truth about why his old number was unreachable, as he tells Neil to give her his new number.

Sage comes into the bathroom angry and reveals that she was eavesdropping on the conversation between Stephen and Maya, and doesn't understand why he suddenly turned around after also telling Sage that he can get Maya a scholarship. The protagonist tells her he is shocked by her never telling him she's a Burke. Sage doesn't understand why this matters so much and asks him what's his family name, to which he replies by revealing that it's Miller, as Sage says she will tell him about the "Morgan" surname on a different occasion.

Despite things not going according to plan, they all sit down for dinner with the Burke family as Tybalt is annoyed by their presence and particularly by Josy's lack of taste in luxury food. The protagonist looks at Sage browsing social media on her phone and she reveals that she's the Tyballs account that's harassing Tybalt. They leave the house and are slightly disappointed with the outcome. In private, a worried Stephen calls a woman named Priscilla and tells her that they need to talk.

Derek and the protagonist conclude the Burke family flashback and then discuss Zoey, as the story jumps to the protagonist's reunification with her back in their hometown. Zoey tries to act friendly and casually as the protagonist reveals that the ending of their relationship was devastating for him, that he was hurt by her not responding to his messages, and that he switched his number and wiped his phone so that he wouldn't have to think about her anymore, revealing to her that Neil lied about the true reason behind him switching numbers. Zoey tells him that she left San Diego after realizing the importance of what she had back home, and the importance of their relationship to her, as they discuss him also thinking Zoey and Bret were a couple after seeing them on social media. Zoey asks the protagonist to restart their relationship as they cry together and discuss their now-improved ability to talk about feelings with each other. The protagonist tells Zoey about his time with the DIKs and the Halloween party he's organizing and invites her to it.

Back in the present, Derek is shocked to hear that the protagonist invited his ex-girlfriend to the party, and goes to talk with her, as the protagonist goes to take care of the party starting.

The protagonist puts on his spartan warrior costume. Leon is dressed as Lily and is pissed at Jamie who was supposed to be dressed as Envy for their themed costume, but bailed out on him to do a magician costume with Dany who is now his girlfriend again. Becky is angry at Christie and Kylie for stealing her idea as all of them are dressed as nurses. The protagonist socializes with some of the dorm girls, including Tiffani and Gina. He then goes to sit at the Moose Lounge with Derek.

The protagonist joins them for a few rounds but when they start asking him questions about Zoey, the power suddenly shuts down. The protagonist makes his way to the fuse box and turns the power back on. During the outage, Becky falls into a tub of fake blood.

The narrator comments in hindsight that although trouble was brewing all night, it was at this point that things started getting very bad. The girls from the Pink Rose arrive, as the preps and someone with a plague doctor mask slip into the party. A topless Tiffani looks at the new arrivals in shock. Gordon sees the girl he met at the dorm party, Beth the cafeteria worker, making out with someone and leaves in anger. The plague doctor finds Quinn inside and reveals himself to be Vinny, as it is also revealed that he and Quinn used to be in a relationship. Quinn is unhappy to see him at the party and reminds him that they agreed that B&R is Quinn's territory, as Vinny claims that Quinn is the one violating their agreement by selling to The Pink Rose. Lily overhears the discussion and rushes to Quinn's aid, arguing that they stopped buying from him because they're quitting and not because of Quinn.

Becky steals Jacob's DIK jacket to replace her soaked clothes. The protagonist walks in on Matthew making out with Olivia, who warns the protagonist to not tell anyone what he saw.

Riona thanks the protagonist for cheering her up and they end up discussing relationships, as Riona initially claims that she doesn't want one but gradually becomes more interested in a relationship and in the protagonist. When the protagonist wears Tara's ghost costume, he is encountered by dorm girl Avery who thinks he's Tara and tells him that they have something good, to his confusion. Tara reveals that Oscar is her boyfriend.

Rusty is sitting on the roof drunk and depressed as the protagonist joins him. He reveals what happened with Micha. Rusty applauds the protagonist for organizing the party and for doing so much even though he just joined the DIKs. Rusty also reveals that his plan B for the windows was to sell his sports car, saying that he loves the DIKs much more than he loves his car, and allows the protagonist to use it if he wants in the future.

The CUM-petition happens in private in the basement, with the loser having embarrassing photos of him taken and posted on the DIK wall. Quinn barges into Tommy's room while he's cheating on Heather with Christie and after kicking Christie out she lets him know that Vinny is in the party.

Sage, Quinn, and the protagonist pick out the best costumes and announce the winner of the costume contest, who receives the penis-shaped trophy that Sage made.

Zoey leaves to catch the last train and looks back at the protagonist as she walks to the door.

In his room, the protagonist encounters a hostile Vinny, who is unhappy with how tidy his old room is and makes a mess in it. They fight and Vinny brandishes his gun, warning the protagonist to back off and calling him a submissive dog as Tommy comes around and asks Vinny to leave. Tommy lies to the now-shaking protagonist that the gun is just a prop and reveals to him that Vinny was here because he bought some drugs from him, asking him not to call the police. The protagonist organizes the mess Vinny made in his room as Tommy goes up the roof to talk with Quinn.

Quinn flashes back to another childhood memory in the drug den with her father Rox, who teaches her the basics of chess. Rox tells Quinn to never trust anyone except for him and to closely monitor every person she's relying on, even Buddy. Rox then tells her that he's going to show her what's in his safe, but that she has to keep it secret.

Back in the present, Tommy tells her what happened in the protagonist's room and Quinn is shocked at the gravity of the situation. Tommy takes the blame for the events on himself, having bought from Vinny because of the petty argument with Quinn, as Quinn interrupts and takes the blame on herself, apologizing for the events of the Hell Week party and revealing that she wanted to tell him she's sorry before but couldn't bring herself to do it because she feared showing weakness. Tommy agrees to stop buying from Vinny as they conclude that Vinny probably knows Quinn is now selling to The Pink Rose.

The party is close to ending and the protagonist says goodbye to the last people as they are leaving. Sally is stuck in the bathroom with no clothes after Quinn sliced the straps of her shirt, and asks the protagonist to bring her some.
