title: Episode 11 - Paradigm Shift (WIP)
---

A flashback shows Lana with her boyfriend. They are in his room and Lana is trying to persuade him to get her cocaine because her birthday is nearing and she wants to try it, after having heard stories about it from her friend Alex who got some from a guy at a party. He initially declines but after Lana goads him by telling him he's scared of the drug dealers he agrees to take her to his dealers to buy some. They drive to the drug den and enter it as Rox and Buddy discuss the movie with the rats that climbed the skyscraper (the scene that appeared in Quinn's flashback). They take the bag of cocaine and get back to their car. It is revealed that Lana's boyfriend is Jonathan.

Quinn is alone in the HOT house and talks with her family members on the phone, as she lies about not being able to come back home for Thanksgiving and tries to avoid having to visit them during Christmas by claiming she's very busy with her studies. She then calls Riona and Riona tells her she's being stalked. Quinn hears Riona getting kidnapped by Vinny and runs out. She finds Riona's phone on the ground where she was kidnapped and calls Buddy, who reveals that they are going to torture Riona to tell them what Quinn is hiding from him.

In Bella's house, Josy, Jill, and Bella are waiting for the rest to return as Derek, Maya, Sage and the protagonist arrive and reveal that they got the contracts. Jill, Bella, and Sage sit down to read them and conclude that Maya doesn't have a student loan, but rather that the contracts are for a loan that Patrick took on his name and that there is an additional contract for a loan that Maya owes to Patrick, which has some contractual obligations but nothing related to Maya's lifestyle. The loan is from "Finnman Banking", which Derek explains is a business partner of Patrick which explains why the loan has very good terms. The conclusion is that Maya can take a student loan to fund college on her own and be free from Patrick's control. The protagonist reveals that he saw Patrick abusing Maya and the group is disturbed to hear that, especially Josy who is hurt that Maya never told her about it. Regardless the group celebrates the positive outcome. Sage drinks a lot trying to forget her family troubles, and is initially happy and dances with Bella but then starts crying and goes to talk in private with the protagonist. They go to a room to talk and Sage reveals that her parents are getting divorced. The protagonist is worried that this has something to do with his affair with Jade. The protagonist invites his love interest to come home with him for the weekend and meet Neil. Jill reveals that she doesn't like Thanksgiving because Lana died around it, shortly before her birthday.

Quinn goes to the drug den and confronts Mick and Buddy who show her Riona's torn piercings. Quinn bursts into tears and asks if Riona is alive and Buddy reveals that they didn't kill her, just hurt her, and that she told them about the increased prices that Quinn charged from customers. Buddy demands that Quinn give him back all the money she obtained that way, telling Quinn that he would have killed her if not for his obligation to Rox. Quinn agrees and asks to see Riona, and Buddy says they dropped her at her mother's apartment, noting that it's helpful to know your customers.

Quinn visits Riona at her mother's apartment and is terrified upon seeing the damage they've done to her. She tells Riona that she will make Buddy pay for that but Riona scolds her and punches her in the face, telling Quinn she didn't protect her as she promised she would. Back in her room at the HOT house, Quinn is broken and packs her belongings, including three bags of cash. She is about to buy a one-way ticket to a different town but then looks at her face painting in the mirror and flashes back to a childhood memory of Rox. In the flashback, young Quinn asks Rox what is his face tattoo about and he explains that it's the paw of an ermine. Rox brings his fairytale book and reads her a story about the ermine being a clever predator who defeats his enemies by surprising and outsmarting them. He explains that Quinn and himself are like the ermine, they are the little people who need to act fast and be aggressive to survive, and that she must never lose her bravery and pride. Quinn regains her resolve and shows up in Buddy's drug den which is now also occupied by Vinny, dropping off two bags of cash on the floor, and tells Buddy that's the money she owes him. Seeing her newfound confidence, Buddy asks what happened to Quinn who cried not long ago, as Vinny hears that and mocks Quinn for having cried over Riona. Quinn promises to do Buddy's bidding from now on as long as he doesn't hurt Riona. As Quinn walks out, she lets Buddy know that Vinny also sold drugs at increased prices, to the terror of Vinny. Outside the den, it is revealed that Quinn used her phone to record the talk with Buddy, as she listens to Buddy in the recording telling her that she has to sell drugs for him if she doesn't want him to hurt her friend anymore.

Tybalt flashes back to Jill kicking him in the balls, as he wakes up in a hospital, having gone through surgery to fix his scrotum after it was torn from the kick. The doctor explains that there is some permanent damage but one of his testicles still works fine, so he should still be fertile, but notes that Tybalt has a case of urinary tract infection and advises him to stop using watermelons as a masturbatory aid.

The protagonist goes back home to visit Neil. He tells Neil about the events of the Thanksgiving dinner at Maya's house to the shock of Neil, they discuss Maya's abusive father and Neil says that he wasn't always a good father to him, which the protagonist rejects saying that he did great. Neil tells him that he's doing yoga now and the protagonist tells him he is practicing sparring with Dwayne at the gym.

In the DIK house, an angry Tommy reveals that Heather broke up with him and confessed to having had sex with one of them at the Halloween party, and a fight breaks out as he's trying to find out who that was. The blame eventually reaches Nick who bursts and scolds Tommy for having treated Heather poorly, admitting what he did with her at the party and that he loves her. They start fighting but are separated by the rest of the DIKs, and Nick blames Tommy for stealing money from the treasury. Leon stops their argument saying he has something important to say and reveals that while he was walking through the dorms with his buddies Marc and Chen, they saw Beth hanging the DIK posters and chased her back to her dorm. At her dorm, they found a bunch of the dorm girls - Avery, Kylie, Penny, Tara, Celine, and a few others - sitting among piles of Cathy posters and DIK posters. The girls admitted that they are the ones hanging the posters, claiming that they do it as revenge against the DIKs for having treated them poorly in the past, mostly due to the walk of shame and Vinny locking one of them out of the mansion naked. They also admitted they got the DIK photos by snapping them on their camera during the Halloween party. Back in the present, Leon is especially hurt by having seen Tara among them, whom he had considered a close friend. As the DIKs are still shocked by the two revelations, Derek intervenes and reveals the hidden camera that he found in his closet and that someone used it to take pictures and send them to the jocks, as Rusty reveals that pictures of DIKs having sex with Arieth that were on their shared laptop were also sent to the jocks and that the jocks claim that the protagonist sent them.

Shocked by all the revelations, the group concludes it's not possible that the dorm girls are also responsible for the camera and it's also not possible that the protagonist sent the images because at the time he didn't have any access to the DIK house or laptop. They discuss the possibility of a traitor among the DIKs and the fight heats up again as initially they blame Vinny but the blame turns to Nick when Tommy mentions that Nick's room wasn't damaged in the assault on the mansion. Tommy interrogates Nick on what he did when the Cathy cluck posted and the DIKs recall the events of that party when the protagonist reveals that he saw Nick at the library where the laptop was found. Nick breaks and admits that he was with the laptop in the library while the cluck was posted and that he tried to hide that until now because he knew it would raise suspicions, but claims that he didn't post the cluck. Tommy doesn't believe Nick and starts a vote to banish him. Rusty tries to reduce the flames and says that Tommy is jumping to conclusions too quickly, but Nick has had enough and announces that he is quitting the fraternity, as he bursts with anger and reveals gossip about each of the DIKs: Leon talking badly about Jamie's relationship with Dany, Jamie saying that Leon is unable to commit to relationships and is jealous, Jacob telling him that he wanted to have sex with Heather and also that he has a crush on Zoey, John Boy having a fantasy about Elena sleeping with others, Tommy thinking that Rusty is a weak leader and everyone being fed up with the protagonist bossing them around.

The next day at campus Derek and the protagonist talk about the fallout as Tara pulls the protagonist over for a talk. Feeling bad about having been seen with the group that is responsible for the posters, Tara explains that this was Avery's idea and that while she didn't want to be a part of it, she also didn't want to betray her friends and snitch on them. She tells their side of the story, how they have been humiliated by the DIKs during the walk of shame, and that one time Vinny pulled a mean prank on Kylie's sister by locking her out of the DIK mansion in her underwear, forcing her to run back to her dorm naked, which prompted the dorm girls to decide to take revenge against the DIKs. Tara explains that they didn't want to hurt Cathy, and they spread those posters just because the DIKs already posted her image online and bragged about it, so they wanted to remind people how bad the DIKs are, and she is surprised to learn that the DIKs aren't those who posted that image. Tara says she wants this fight to stop and suggests the DIKs apologize to the girls for what they did.

Before class, the protagonist asks Ashley to help him ask Anthony about the letters and why he said that the protagonist sent them. Anthony tells him that this is what Chad said when he got them and that it didn't make sense to him either because the pictures are too old. In class, Camila reveals to the protagonist that she has been lacking sexual satisfaction lately and they joke about having sex. Isabella is amused at Derek's writing skills and concludes that he's a genius, and his "cheating" on tests is just using tricks to memorize things easily. She strikes a deal with him to leave him alone for the rest of the semester if he doesn't cause any trouble in class.

</details></p>

John Boy tells the protagonist that he saw Nick pack his things and leave. He confronts the protagonist about him having wanted Elena to have sex with him but says that the part about DIKs hating the protagonist for acting like a leader is false and probably just Nick's thoughts. The protagonist tells him about his discussion with Tara and that the dorm girls are not the ones who posted the image of Cathy on the DIK social media account.

In his room, the protagonist starts taking care of the fish on his own now that Nick left, and solves the black metal box on his table, which ends up containing nothing. The protagonist asks Sage for Chad's number. Bella tells the protagonist she had a lot of fun at the little party they had at her house at Thanksgiving, and invites the group to a Christmas dinner she's organizing which will take place before the actual date of Christmas Eve.

The protagonist meets Chad at the library and tries to understand why he told the jocks that it was he who sent the letters. He reveals to Chad that he knows about his relationship with Troy, but explains that he got to know of it when he saw them in the locker room on a later occasion, much after the letters were sent. He also reveals to Chad that he told Sage, as Chad is shocked to learn that Sage knows about it but didn't use it against him. The protagonist tells Chad that's because Sage is a good person and that he mistreated her during their relationship, adding to the guilt of Chad. Chad explains that his letter contained a picture of him and Troy, and since he received the letters shortly after Dawe caught the protagonist spying on him in the locker room, he assumed it was his way to take revenge against him for bullying him after he talked with Sage. The protagonist explains that when he spied on Chad talking on the phone he thought that Chad was talking with a girl, to the dismay of Chad who realizes that someone else knows about his secret. The protagonist asks Chad to investigate why the jocks didn't destroy Nick's room when they trashed the mansion.

Derek suggests that he can either take this secret to his grave or tell Sage about it, which will likely ruin their relationship. When asked what would he do, Derek says that he would pick "option three", which is to end his relationship with Sage without explaining why, which would make Sage feel bad but at least won't ruin her relationship with Jade.

Heather finds Josy in their room with piles of clothes and Josy explains that she has been searching for something to do lately and ended up deciding to start a women's fashion blog. Heather reveals she has been told that Riona isn't around because she has the flu.

The next morning, Sage tells the protagonist about her biological family. She reveals that she never knew her father and that her mother was not able to take care of her, either due to her age or being poor, which is why she gave her up for adoption. She says she has some memories of her, such as the smell of burnt wood and pine cones, and perfume on a fleece jacket, but that she hasn't been able to search for information about her or ask her adopting parents about her because she's scared of finding out more about her. The narrator notes that Sage needed him to be her rock, but he couldn't bring himself to do so because he was still unsure what to do about their relationship, imagining that there was a fourth option that would fix everything.

The story skips forward in time, as the narrator talks about him not liking winters, but that at least it wasn't snowing much. The group - him, Derek, Sage, Maya, Josy, Jill, and Bella - grew closer, as Maya was getting ready to confront Patrick and Josy was spending time alone.

In the DIK mansion, Leon tells the protagonist he heard that the HOTs will be going to the Christmas party at the alphas, and they discuss whether they should party with the dorm girls. Melanie and Elena ask the protagonist for help moving some boxes to the HOTs' house as they explain that the DIKs and HOTs share the same inventory of Christmas decorations so it's a mess every year when they decorate and need to understand what is where. The protagonist walks in on Rusty making out with Micha and walks out. Rusty approaches the protagonist and explains that he started dating her again even though she's still with her ex and that he's hoping she will eventually break up with him. Ashley and Derek are getting closer. At the HOT house, the protagonist talks with Sage who explains that she's in a tight spot with having to balance out who they party with to not violate the truce agreement.

The protagonist flirts with Sarah and they go to the pool area, as Sarah also notes that she's been deprived of sexual satisfaction lately. Quinn tells the protagonist she is still not ready to talk with him. When Lily jokes about giving a blowjob to the protagonist, Sage pulls him to the side and asks him about the nature of his relationship with Lily and whether he's alright with her using him like that. The protagonist admits that he has feelings for Lily but has no idea what she's trying to do or what it means to "roll" with her, and confronts Lily about the issue and Lily immediately figures that Sage caused him to be worried about this. Lily is mad that Sage is sabotaging their relationship and intends to talk with her about that, but the protagonist asks her not to and instead he and Lily go to her room to talk in private. Lily tells the protagonist her life story, revealing that she used to be fat and ugly and bullied by kids in school, and then decided to turn her life around because she wanted people to like her, so she became fit and sexually provocative, but that only caused people to instead call her dumb and a slut. Lily also reveals that her parents disapproved of her new lifestyle and that she had to leave home when they gave her an ultimatum to either stop working as a stripper or leave. The protagonist and Lily hug.

Back in the DIK house, Tommy is bummed out that they aren't going to have the HOTs at the Christmas party and Leon and the protagonist come up with a plan to have a party one day before the alphas' party, which will both allow the HOTs to attend and make them hungover the next day thus ruining the party for the alphas. Leon motivates the protagonist to plan the party on his own by the method of "WWTD" - what would Tommy do. The protagonist goes to his room to plan it, deciding that it's going to be a Christmas panty party, with everyone in underwear and there will be masks in the entrance for those who don't feel comfortable being recognized. Derek will be in charge of creating a bowl full of sexual tasks that guests must pick out a task from.

Sally comes over to write the lab report with the protagonist and although she's initially antagonistic to him, they end up having a great time together.

At Lana's grave, Jill talks about her discontent with having seen the DIKs do drugs at the barbecue, revealing that Lana died due to drug use and that she only learned the true cause of death when she was a teenager, as initially, her parents lied to her that Lana died in an accident. Jill flashes back to the first time she met up with Jonathan, many years after Lana's death. In the flashback, Jill accuses Jonathan of killing Lana and Jonathan tears up as he recalls the story of her death. After they had taken the cocaine from Buddy, they went to the party and he tried to persuade Lana not to use it, and eventually left her on her own because he didn't want to be a part of that. When he came back, he saw Lana passed out with foam in her mouth, and the paramedics announced her death, as it turned out that the cocaine was diluted with too much fentanyl and she died from fentanyl overdose. Jonathan explains that he was immediately regarded by everyone on the scene as responsible for Lana's death, although he regrets having been too scared to admit that he's the one who gave her the cocaine. Jonathan recalls that he was told by Lana's parents not to come to the funeral, but he still came, although he watched it from a distance to not offend them. Jonathan then reveals that he has gone through years of therapy and decided to devote his career to lecturing against drug use and helping drug victims, inviting Jill to visit him in a weekly therapy group he has been hosting where victims share their stories.

She was seven years old at the time and afterward, Buddy put her in a foster home because there was nobody left to care for her, as her mom was a drug addict.

The hungover HOTs are at the alphas Christmas party, as Alex reveals to Dawe that the DIKs had a party the previous day. Dawe confronts Sage who tells him that herself, Josy and Maya weren't at that party and that she can't tell the HOTs what to do with their free time as they are individuals.
