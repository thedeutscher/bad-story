A flashback shows a younger Rusty in the ANO mansion hitting on Jill. Rusty reveals that he is part of the Burgmeister family, and Jill reveals that she is part of the Royce family. Tybalt does not accept Rusty to the ANO fraternity. On the way out he encounters Tommy smoking, and Tommy convinces him to start their own fraternity, as Heather rolls into college on a wheelchair. Rusty tries to convince a younger Sage to have the HOTs party with their new DIK fraternity instead of with the jocks but fails. Nick and Vinny come to pledge for the newly formed DIKs and together they form the traditions that are now part of hell week.

Back at the preset the devils pledge board is being evaluated as it is revealed that some of the tasks were meant to be impossible, and that the goal was not to complete the board but to see how the maggot brothers go through it. Rusty reveals the DIKs secret code: every DIK has a single opportunity to use the secret code to force all other DIKs to completely forget an event, meaning that they are never allowed to talk about it happening with anybody.

The evaluation ends successfully although the maggots forgot to egg the "preps" (the ANO fraternity), but the HOT girls that were supposed to come to the hell week party are nowhere to be found. Arieth answers the phone and tells Tommy that she's at a hell week party in the Tri-Alpha house, and the DIKs ready themselves to assault the jocks. They break the Tri-Alpha house windows but it turns out that the HOTs aren't there and only Arieth is. Humiliated, the DIKs continue searching for the HOTs and suspect they are at the ANO mansion.

At Isabella's house, Jill and Bella comfort Cathy after the photo leak incident. Derek uses his roommate's quad-copter to spy on the ANO mansion and it is revealed that the HOTs have agreed to entertain the guests of the ANO's Dante Week celebration, who are mostly rich B&R graduates in fancy suits. Quinn wants to make a "business proposal" to Tybalt as Derek and the protagonist steal suits from the mansion and slip into the party undercover. There, they meet the HOT girls dissatisfied with having to be entertainment at such a boring party. Riona reveals that Quinn made this arrangement with the ANO because they were short on money. Josy hears that her father is coming and asks the protagonist to be with her because she didn't leave home on good terms after the fight with him and Monica and is scared of what might happen. The protagonist takes a picture of his dick on Tybalt's phone. Mona storms out of a room saying she can't do it as Prof. Stephen also exits the room. Jade is with Tybalt as Stephen comes around and is unhappily surprised to see her at the party, saying she was supposed to meet with Cathy, to which Jade replies that Cathy cancelled on her choosing to be with Bella instead.

The protagonist calls Quinn but she is busy selling drugs to ANO vice-president Rich, who wants to buy cocaine but is convinced by Quinn, who doesn't sell cocaine, to buy some hash instead. Sage comes around and reveals that while it's true that the HOTs struck a deal with the ANO because they needed money, Quinn hasn't done her part of updating Tommy and Rusty that the HOTs won't be at the DIKs hell week celebration. Sage tells the protagonist that Tommy and Rusty are running the fraternity by relying on money from Rusty's rich family, but that is not how fraternities and sororities should be run. Sage also reveals that her dad is attending the ANO party. The protagonist tells Sage about his deceased mother and she feels bad for him.

Josy's dad has arrived and the protagonist and Maya go looking for them. Despite Josy getting ready to fight with her dad, the meeting with him goes surprisingly well as it turns out he is supportive of her going to B&R and becomes emotional about having wanted to see his daughter on her first day at college. They make up as he brings Josy the rest of her belongings and lets her know that he transferred the payments for her tuition. Back at the party, Maya is sad that her father is nowhere nearly as supportive as Josy's father.

Derek hears about the deal between the HOT and the ANO and plots to get the girls out by activating the sprinkler system and thus end the party early. Everybody runs out and the preps are horrified at the damage done to their suits by the sprinklers. Outside, Tybalt confronts the protagonist and mocks him. Derek and the protagonist throw eggs at the preps thus finishing their pledge board.

While walking back to their house the DIKs don't understand why Quinn went behind their backs like this instead of just asking the DIKs to pay the HOTs for attending the party. They conclude that something else is going on but as they arrive back at the mansion, they find it completely destroyed with signs of the Tri-Alphas having been there while the DIKs were out. They don't know what to do as they don't have insurance and they don't want to call the police because of what they've done to the ANO mansion.

The protagonist goes to Bella's house to talk with Cathy. He tells the DIKs side of the story and manages to make her feel much better after assuring her that nobody is making fun of her and everyone is just scared of the repercussions. The protagonist drives Cathy home and advises her to stop using dating apps. Cathy is surprised that he knew it was her on the app and they have sex in Bella's car. Back at Bella's house, Jill and Bella praise the protagonist for helping with Cathy. Bella reveals to the protagonist that Jill is of the Royce family, to the dismay of Jill who says it was a secret. Bella tries to understand why was it supposed to be a secret as the discussion gets tense and Jill accuses Bella of also hiding a secret from her about the protagonist sleeping in her home. They apologize for blaming each other as Tybalt calls and tells Jill of what the protagonist and the DIKs did at the ANO mansion. Bella tells a story about her doing hell week when she was in college and falsely confessing to her teacher that she had a crush on him. The protagonist plays Bella's favorite song on his guitar. When Bella says it's her favorite song and he says that he remembered that, Bella and Jill exchange glances as Jill looks worried.

At Quinn's room Tommy is furious as Quinn reveals that the ANO party deal was not meant to raise money for the sorority, but rather to increase the profits of her own drug sale operation because sales have been low lately. However, the plan failed and she barely made enough money to cover this month. Tommy tells her that the DIK mansion was destroyed during that night because of her and she is shocked to hear that. Tommy also tells her that he feels betrayed as Quinn's expression shows regret or uneasiness with the situation.

Bella and Jill are in bed as Bella is uncomfortable and an annoyed Jill assures her that it won't happen again as they talk about an understanding they had. Bella asks her to stop talking about it as Jill snaps and goes to sleep on the couch with the protagonist. Bella drops the photo of that was on her nightstand to the floor, a photo of her and James on their wedding day. The next day, the protagonist asks Jill about the wedding photo and about the mysterious locked door, and Jill refuses to give him any information. They do yoga together and Bella asks Jill about her tennis date with the protagonist, mentioning that if they talked about it earlier they could have avoided the argument yesterday.

At the HOT house, Heather and Riona are complaining about the ANO party and blame Sage for arranging that. Quinn talks to someone on the phone saying that she has everything now and they schedule to meet tomorrow night. Camila tells Quinn that Mona wants out of the "free tuition" arrangement. Sage and the protagonist practice guitar at the HOT house porch and discuss the events of last night. Sage tells him that the HOTs need to earn enough money to fund the sorority and that's why they sometimes have to take deals such as entertaining at the ANO party, and that all fraternities also work to obtain their funds with the DIKs being the only exception. They kiss as Sarah and Melanie watch them from the window and talk about the how this relationship will make it easier for Sage when Chad breaks up with her. Sarah and Melanie promise to have each other's back if things go wrong as Melanie goes to call Chad.

At the DIK mansion, the DIKs are in shambles over how much damage has been done to their mansion and try to convince Rusty to get more money from his dad, as Rusty reveals that he has been using the funds his dad told him to save on the deal with The Pink Rose. The protagonist, now a DIK among equals, motivates them and tells them they shouldn't rely on Rusty's dad and should instead work together to obtain money and fix the damage. They plan to look for jobs in the community center and have Neil supply them with materials from his construction site to fix the house. Everyone agrees with the plan and applauds the protagonist for his speech except for Tommy who is pissed and goes to his room. Derek and the protagonist get their DIK jackets.
