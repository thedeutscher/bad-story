# Episode 4 - Worlds Colliding

A flashback shows pre-college Josy and Maya in a camping trip with Derek and his then-girlfriend Lynn. While Derek and Lynn make out in their tent, Josy and Maya go swimming together and discover their feelings for each other.

The protagonist asks to stay the night at a friend's house. At their place, he reflects about what followed after Josy appeared in Maya's dorm: after revealing that Josy is her girlfriend, Maya introduces the protagonist to Josy, not knowing that they have already met. Josy realizes the complexity of the situation and excuses herself to the bathroom, while Maya tells the protagonist that her relationship with Josy has not been as good lately, and also that her relationship with him has become more important to her. In a text message Josy urges the protagonist to also come to the bathroom to talk with her, where they discuss Maya and their own relationship. The protagonist takes his things from the dorm and storms out, as Maya and Josy sit down to talk and sort out the problems they had in their relationship.

The next day, Quinn comes to Maya's dorm to wake her up and meets Josy, who also wants to pledge the HOTs. Quinn initially refuses but then turns around when she learns that Josy is Tommy's stepsister. Derek meets the protagonist and learns from him that Josy is the girl he's been dating, and also that Josy's stepbrother Tommy is the same Tommy who is the DIK vice-president. Derek enters a fight with Wendy at a feminist protest and gets dragged to the counselor office.

Riona is feeling watched. Quinn reveals that Dawe no longer wants to buy drugs from her because he's afraid of being caught now that they are being watched after what Chad did. Riona is worried about their business. In a flashback to the party at the DIK house, Quinn and Tommy discuss the HOTs ditching the Tri-Alphas and partying with the DIKs, in exchange for Tommy buying more drugs from Quinn. Quinn tells Riona she has a plan that might upset the DIKs, and involves Sage.

Josy and Jill get to know each other in class. In the library, Jill introduces her new friend Josy to the protagonist, and reveals to her that she has an upcoming date with him. The DIKs discuss Arieth having an STD, as Jamie is worried that his feminist girlfriend Danie might be pregnant. Derek invites the protagonist to a night at The Pink Rose and installs a dating app on his phone to help him get past Maya & Josy. Sage invites him to a movie night with the HOTs.

Tommy is pissed at Quinn for getting Josy to join the HOTs. It is revealed that last time at The Pink Rose, the protagonist got so drunk that he stripped and began dancing naked in the cage until the bouncer kicked him out. The protagonist sees Cathy on the dating app. The protagonist also chats on the app with Envy, whose real name is Nicole. Isabella comes to terms with having sexual attraction to the protagonist. At class, Derek gets into an argument again with the feminist Minny. Jade texts the protagonist and they plan a meeting in a secluded place.

The protagonist goes to his date with Jill and they play tennis. He reveals to Jill that he's been dating Josy and that Josy and Maya hurt him. Jill understands and says it is alright to date multiple people as long as he is not in a relationship with any of them. Jill reveals that she had an older sister that passed away. She also mentions that her family focuses a lot on appearances, and that many men she meets are not genuine because of her family. She is then amused that the protagonist doesn't know what family she belongs to and says she would rather leave it this way. They talk about Bella and the protagonist tells Jill about the time Bella found him naked in the street, to the surprise of Jill who didn't know about this despite being close with Bella.

The party at the DIK house is starting. However, Rusty bursts in and panics as it turns out that someone stole and used the DIK laptop with their social media account to post naked images of Cathy. The party goes on as the DIKs are trying to understand what happened. Rusty lets the protagonist know that the DIKs have a lot of respect for him for tackling the jocks, and that Tommy isn't doing a good job telling him the things that he should know. Rusty also reveals that his name is Russel Burgmeister. In the house's old library where the laptop was found, the protagonist finds Nick still searching for the laptop and lets him know that it was already found. Nick is reminiscing about his best friend Vinny who used to live in the library before he dropped out, and says that he still meets him outside of college. Tommy and Quinn invite the protagonist to smoke weed with them on the roof, and the protagonist ends up having sex with Quinn.
