---

A flashback shows pre-college Josy and Maya on a camping trip with Derek and his then-crush Lynn. Maya reveals that Derek is into Lynn and in return, Derek reveals that she's into Josy. While Derek and Lynn have sex in their tent, Josy and Maya go swimming and then discover their feelings for each other.

The protagonist asks to stay the night at a friend's house. At their place, he reflects on what followed after Josy appeared in Maya's dorm: after revealing that Josy is her girlfriend, Maya introduces the protagonist to Josy, not knowing that they have already met. Josy realizes the complexity of the situation and excuses herself to the bathroom, while Maya tells the protagonist that her relationship with Josy has not been as good lately, and also that her relationship with him has become more important to her. In a text message, Josy urges the protagonist to also come to the bathroom to talk with her, where they discuss Maya and their relationship. The protagonist takes his things from the dorm and storms out, as Maya and Josy sit down to talk and sort out the problems they had in their relationship. Josy tells Maya that she had an argument with her dad and didn't have access to her phone as a result, and Maya tells her that her dad is now making surprise visits to her dorm and questioning Derek about her.

The next day at the HOT house, Sage talks with the protagonist about the role of the vice president and says that Quinn is very helpful and a good vice president. Sage reveals that Dawe's family owns the gym which is why it is sponsoring the Tri-Alpha fraternity, and also that she's graduating at the end of the year. It is revealed that Ashley and Lily also want to pledge the HOTs now, pending approval from Quinn. Quinn is delighted to learn about the conflict between Maya and the protagonist and lets Riona know that Dawe visited bearing bad news. Sarah and Melanie discuss Chad being kicked out of the Tri-Alpha fraternity and say that the rumor is the protagonist beat him up.

Quinn goes to Maya's dorm to wake her up and meets Josy, who also wants to pledge the HOTs. Quinn initially refuses but then turns around when she learns that Josy is Tommy's stepsister.

Derek meets the protagonist and learns from him that Josy is the girl he's been dating, and also that Josy's stepbrother Tommy is the same Tommy who is the DIK vice-president. It is revealed that Stanley the bouncer threw the protagonist out of The Pink Rose the night when he blacked out. They discuss Rusty being a better father to Derek than Tommy is to the protagonist. Derek warns the protagonist that Tommy will be furious if he learns about his relationship with Josy. Derek enters a fight with Wendy at a feminist protest and gets dragged to the counselor's office.

Riona is being watched. Quinn reveals to her that Dawe no longer wants to buy steroids from them because he's afraid of being caught now that they are being watched after what Chad did. Riona is worried about their business. A flashback shows Quinn and Tommy high in the private zone at the CUM-petition party in the DIK house and Heather lies passed out next to them. They make a deal where the HOTs will ditch the jocks and party with the DIKs, in exchange for Tommy and the DIKs buying drugs from Quinn and using the DIK mansion as an avenue for using and selling drugs, and the DIKs taking the blame for it if they get caught, as it revealed that Sage doesn't know about Quinn's drugs and that Rusty is a Burgmeister and therefore gets special treatment from the counselors. Back in the present, Quinn tells Riona she has a plan that might upset the DIKs. She tells Riona that the first step of the plan is Sage, hinting that the next step is therefore someone related to Sage.

Camila and Mona offer to help the protagonist with the task of getting slapped as thanks for helping them with the underwear task. Dawe is hitting on Lily and Cathy is swiping profiles of men on her phone. Josy and Jill get to know each other in class and Jill offers to show her around. In the library, the protagonist makes a deal with Magnar to get a video of him giving him a wedgie as Jill helps Josy get the books she needs. Jill introduces her new friend Josy to the protagonist and reveals to her that she has an upcoming date with him. The DIKs discuss Arieth having an STD as Mona and Camila arrive and slap the protagonist in front of the DIKs for supposedly having sex with them and not calling them back. Jamie is worried that his girlfriend Dany might be pregnant.

Derek reveals that Tommy heard Josy is joining the HOTs and is very angry about it and that he told Rusty about the protagonist being depressed, so Rusty is getting the DIKs to another night out at The Pink Rose. He invites the protagonist to join and installs a dating app on his phone to help him get past Maya & Josy.

Sage invites the protagonist to a movie night with the HOTs. Tybalt begins being harassed on social media by a user named "Tyballs" who pretends to be him and mocks him. It is revealed that Caleb, a new student who is physically huge and very strong, is now pledging the jocks. Mona and Camila post a picture of their asses on social media for a scavenger hunt task. The protagonist transcribes Jill's notes to tabs and begins practicing the song on his guitar. The protagonist sees Cathy on the dating app, only slightly hiding her face and going under the name "C", and chats with her. He also chats on the app with Envy, whose real name is Nicole, who reveals that she has a son and that her pregnancy with him caused her to not be able to go to college.

Sage and the protagonist have a swimming race in the HOT pool and it is revealed that Sage is a sore loser and often cheats in games. The protagonist talks with her about moving on from her relationship with Chad and she tells him that it's not very different from him refusing to let go of Maya. In the HOT sauna, Sarah and Melanie try to push their daughters Ashley and Lily to do sexual things with the protagonist, as Lily has no problems with it but Ashley is reluctant to do so. It is also revealed that what caused Ashley to finally pledge the HOTs was that she learned that Maya was pledging. Ashley says that she initially thought she wouldn't fit the HOTs, but if even Maya, who is a feminist, decided to pledge, then so can she, and reveals that she likes Maya. 

Isabella comes to terms with having a sexual attraction to the protagonist. She reveals that James did something but she has forgiven him, as she worries what might happen if James comes back home one day. Isabella also reveals that she has some tensions with Jade.

In The Pink Rose, Stanley is reluctant to let the protagonist in but Rusty promises that he won't cause any trouble this time. Tommy is sitting alone angry and the protagonist drinks beer with him and confronts him about not being a good maggot father and not telling him as many things as Rusty tells Derek. Tommy reveals that he is angry because Josy got accepted and that Quinn enjoys using Josy to piss Tommy off which is why she allowed her to join the HOTs and promises to try to be a better father to the protagonist. Rusty introduces the protagonist to the stripper Sandy and reveals that the DIKs sometimes order girls from The Pink Rose to parties and CUM-petitions. The protagonist asks Rose what has he done last time that got him kicked out and she reveals that he stripped and began to dance naked, then ran away from Stanley who tried to catch him.

At the HOTs' movie night, Quinn presents the newest pledges Ashley, Lily, and Josy. The protagonist and Sage drink from her bottle of whiskey and end up having sex in her room. The protagonist notes that someone must have heard them but Sage thinks only Quinn did, revealing that after Quinn saw them last time she talked with her about it and Quinn won't be spreading it around.

The next day in class the protagonist tells Derek about having seen Cathy on the dating app. Derek gives a wedgie to his nerd dorm mate Bert. In gender studies class, Derek gets into an argument again with the feminist Minny, as the protagonist sits to talk with a shy student named Karen to avoid talking with Maya. At the end of the class, the protagonist calls Neil who has no time to talk, and tells him to follow his heart. Seeing that he is depressed, Jade sits down to talk with the protagonist and tells him about the time she found out Stephen was cheating on her when he was drunk and accidentally called her Cathy in bed, and how their marriage deteriorated from then until reaching the point where she doesn't care about Stephen at all. Jade and the protagonist plan to meet that night in a secluded place.

The protagonist goes on his date with Jill and they play tennis. He reveals to Jill that he's been dating Josy and that Josy and Maya hurt him. Jill understands and says it is alright to date multiple people as long as he is not in a relationship with any of them. Due to a water pipe bursting, the women's changing rooms are closed and the protagonist and Jill shower in the same changing room, and Jill accidentally sees him naked and feels bad for it. Jill reveals that she had an older sister who passed away. She also mentions that her family focuses a lot on appearances and that many men she meets are not genuine because of her family. She is then amused that the protagonist doesn't know what family she belongs to and says she would rather leave it this way. They talk about Bella and the protagonist tells Jill about the time Bella found him naked in the street, to the surprise of Jill who didn't know about this despite being close to Bella. The protagonist notes that Jill feels very mature and contrasts that with the atmosphere at the DIK mansion. 

The party at the DIK house is starting as the DIKs and HOTs sit to play "spin the dildo", a game where people spin a dildo and make out with whoever it points to. Tommy doesn't want Josy to join the game but Quinn makes her join and play the first turn to piss Tommy off. Maya makes out with Josy, and Josy makes out with the protagonist. The game is cut short when Rusty bursts in panicking and reveals that someone stole the DIK laptop which is logged in to their social media account and used it to post a naked image of Cathy. Rusty finds the laptop and removes the post and the party goes on as the DIKs try to understand what happened.

In the mansion's janitor closet, there's now a bucket with the dildos the jocks threw into the mansion the last time, and a candy cane next to it. Jacob tells the protagonist that he is sure that it's not a DIK who did this. Jamie and Leon discuss the post, Jamie thinks it's the jocks but Leon disagrees, saying that they're too stupid to do this and that it has to be someone who was at the DIK mansion multiple times before to prepare for stealing the laptop. Leon reveals that the laptop is shared by all DIKs and they both look troubled when the protagonist suggests that it may have been done by a DIK. John Boy reveals that before the images were posted he couldn't find Rusty, and that he heard some moans from Rusty's room, and assumed he was having sex with someone there. Rusty tells the protagonist that the laptop was found in the old library, and also that the DIKs have a lot of respect for him for tackling the jocks, and that Tommy isn't doing a good job telling him the things that he should know. Rusty also reveals that his full name is Russell Burgmeister, and tells the protagonist that Cathy likes him because of his family. In the house's old library where the laptop was found, the protagonist finds Nick still searching for the laptop and lets him know that it has already been found. Nick is reminiscing about his best friend Vinny who used to live in the library before he dropped out, and says that he still meets him outside of college.

Camila takes care of Mona who drank too much. The protagonist calls Sage to ask where is she and she reveals that she won't be coming to the party because she has to take care of some sorority-related stuff, as she's seen being near the ANO mansion. The protagonist lets Jill know that a naked photo of Cathy leaked and Jill says she will call her to check how is she. Tommy is still angry at Quinn for getting Josy to join the party and the game as he reveals that Josy told on him when he sniffed her nail polish to get high as a kid, and Quinn dismisses his anger. Tommy and Quinn invite the protagonist to smoke weed with them on the roof, and the protagonist ends up having sex with Quinn there and being seen by Jacob who is taking a piss outside. From the roof they see a feminist protest passing near the mansion and Tommy calls Derek to get him to crash the protest again.

Back inside the house Ashley and Lily talk with Maya and Josy, who have now been paired for the scavenger hunt, about their scavenger hunt task lists and figure out that the lists are completely different and that Maya and Josy's list is much harder. Lily offers Josy to become a stripper. Ashley asks the protagonist about Derek and he lets her know that Derek went outside to crash the feminist protest. In the old library, Maya, Josy, and the protagonist meet and he reveals to them that they both cheated on each other with him. They talk and forgive each other, and discuss the possibility of being in a relationship as a group of three.

Back at Maya's dorm, the three of them discuss how they can cheat the scavenger hunt tasks so that Maya gets her free tuition. Josy reveals that she left her house for B&R without talking to her dad.

The protagonist meets Jade in her car and she drives him home discreetly. They have sex and are almost caught by her husband Stephen. The protagonist gets Jade to record a video of them having sex on his phone. In the discussion between Jade and Stephen, it is revealed that Jade has threatened him with a divorce multiple times before. 

The next day, the protagonist and Derek finish the rest of the beers that they need to drink, as Derek shamefully reveals that he had public sex with one of the feminists last night.

The HOTs and DIKs both do their "sexy car wash" tasks. An old lady arrives to get her car washed by the DIKs and reveals that she used to be a teacher at B&R before retiring, and Derek goes off with her. On the side, Quinn and Sage discuss Quinn's plan for getting more money, and Sage confirms that she made the arrangement and that the person who she discussed it with wanted to do this for a long time. Sage is discontent with the plan and with Quinn taking six pledges this year. Quinn says that if the plan fails, Sage's family can sponsor them instead, and Sage gets mad at her for saying that. Sage lets Quinn know that she will go with her plan this time but tells Quinn that she should be the one to break the news to Rusty and Tommy.

Derek is back and reveals that he had sex with the old lady to complete the task of having sex with a teacher. They look at the pledge board as the protagonist has a feeling that they forgot to do something. Tommy calls someone on his phone but doesn't get an answer and is angry about them having not yet arrived at the party, as he announces that the girls will arrive soon. The maggots and the DIKs gather to evaluate hell week.
