title: Episode 6 - Damage Control
---

At a drug den, Rox and Buddy, two gangsters, talk and do cocaine as a woman lies passed out next to them. They discuss a scene from a movie they saw where a rat climbs a skyscraper, and Rox tells Buddy that it's symbolism that means the rats are going to get to you, no matter how far you are. The flashback is then viewed from the first-person perspective of someone who Rox affectionately calls "Q" as she enters the room and he tells her to get back to bed, asking the passed-out woman why didn't she tuck her in. Buddy jokingly calls Q a rat and Rox threatens him with a knife. It is seen that Rox has a face painting identical to the one that Quinn has.

Back at college, Derek and the protagonist walk into the main building with their DIK jackets as flyers of Cathy's naked photo are being spread around campus. The protagonist removes his sunglasses and it is seen that he has a black eye. Chad waves to Cathy who ignores him. The protagonist and Derek encounter the jocks as Dawe looks happy. Cathy and Rusty go to the counselor's office. The time rewinds to before the scene happened.

At the HOT house, Quinn wants to talk privately with Mona and Camila about Mona's change of heart, as Lily reveals to Quinn that she knows about Quinn's prostitution business and joins the discussion. Mona explains that she was disgusted by the person whom she had to service and just couldn't do it. She begs Quinn to let her out of the deal and promises not to tell anyone about this or the drug business, revealing to Lily that Quinn also deals in drugs. Quinn is furious and kicks out Lily and Camila. Quinn is worried that Mona knows too much. She reveals that Prof. Stephen was the client Mona didn't service and threatens to use that information to frame Mona of sex solicitation and have her expelled if she doesn't keep her mouth shut. Outside, Lily reveals that she was eavesdropping on the blackmail conversation to the dismay of Quinn. Lily inquires Quinn about the drug business but Quinn refuses to talk with her.

A flashback shows Vinny, Nick, and Rusty beginning the DIK tradition of the "Walk of Shame", where they cheer and sing as women who slept with DIK members leave the mansion in the morning. They cheer as a girl named Lisa walks out of Tommy's room. In a series of more recent flashbacks, the current DIKs are cheering at girls leaving Nick's room and Jamie's room, as well as Arieth leaving Jacob's room.

The DIKs decide to rent a dumpster to clean all the trash from the mansion and buy a roll of tarp to cover the windows until they get them fixed. Rusty applauds the protagonist again for showing leadership when even he didn't know what to do, as the funds from his dad have been depleted and he is not likely to get more from him. He gives him the library to live in and the protagonist goes to talk to Tommy to sort out their feud. Maya and Josy contemplate cheating on their remaining scavenger hunt tasks. The protagonist finds Tommy in his room bitter and angry, sitting on the floor and drinking. The conversation heats up as the protagonist blames Tommy for not being there when the DIKs need him and for not having been there as his maggot father when he needed him. Tommy flashes back to a time when Vinny accused him of not doing enough to be worthy of being the vice president and in his rage punches the protagonist.

The protagonist and Tommy laugh and make amends with each other. They discuss the recent fights between the DIKs and the jocks. The protagonist mentions that the jocks seem to have shown restraint until the DIKs assaulted their house and that it's peculiar that they would go for such a risky move now given how much they are in trouble due to Chad. Tommy is angry at Quinn and says that they shouldn't party with the HOTs anymore.

Tybalt invites Jill for a talk and is eating watermelon when he tells her that his precious Italian jacket was ruined when he used it to put out the fire in the mansion, which was started by the protagonist. Tybalt says that Trent wants to press charges against the protagonist for the damage done at the party, claiming that he tried to convince Trent not to but Trent is very petty and wants to go through with it. Tybalt tells Jill he can convince Trent not to press charges, but that he wants Jill to do something for him in return.

The protagonist moves into the old library and sleeps on a couch. Nick reveals that Tommy hated Vinny and that until Vinny dropped out they were always fighting over power. Jacob reveals that his hobby is drawing and that all of his drawings were ruined in the assault. Jamie reveals that he and Leon were recruited during the previous semester after already hanging out with the DIKs before they became maggots. Rusty lets the protagonist use the DIK laptop after he has changed the social media passwords and put more security boundaries in place. The laptop contains images and documents that DIKs uploaded to it as well as the ones used for Hell Week evaluations. A text file notes that everything from the laptop is synced to a cloud storage account. Inside Jamie's folder, there's an unsent letter to Dany where it is revealed that Jamie hates the way Dany treats him but is scared of leaving her and being alone. It also reveals that they got together during his Hell Week when he was drunk from all the beers, that he's cheating on her a lot, and that he likes to write poetry.

On social media, it is revealed that the jocks played basketball and accidentally hit Riona, that Ashley and Anthony are getting closer, and that Maya and Josy had a movie night in their dorm with Camila and Mona. Tybalt is bragging about his new watch and is still harassed by "Tyballs", as the protagonist also joins in on mocking him.

Tommy lets the protagonist know that he wants them to spend time together on Friday to try and fix their relationship. In class, Derek tries to hide from Wendy as Dany walks in with Jamie and accuses the protagonist of getting Jamie into trouble. Jamie and the protagonist talk about her and Jamie tells him that he is considering breaking up with her but is worried that she might be pregnant. Ashley is avoiding Derek.

Rusty gets out of the discussion with Cathy and reveals that after hearing what she's been through he cried, calling the DIK secret code on the event. He also reveals that Cathy believes that it's not the DIKs who leaked her photos, letting them go without punishment, and that Cathy is close to him and his father and helped them form the fraternity when it was just starting.

In Sage's room, Chad breaks up with Sage. Sage is furious and hits him. Sarah, Melanie, and Elena hear the shouts and rush into her room to see the fight unfolding.

Derek tells the protagonist that he bought the tarp and that Jamie will pick it up with his grandfather's van. Rusty announces that he found an easy job for the DIKs: accompanying lonely elderly folk at the nearby elderly home. Tommy doesn't like the proposal and goes off to find a better job. Sage calls the protagonist and tells him what happened with Chad.

Quinn goes to the drug den to meet Buddy as she is unaware that she's being followed by someone. At the den, an unnamed elderly woman passes by and shoves her out of the way. Buddy scolds Quinn for dressing suspiciously and goes to fetch her payment. Buddy is surprised that the elderly woman doesn't recognize Quinn anymore even given her face paint. Quinn says that it's not for her but for "him", to which Buddy replies that Quinn was always daddy's girl. Buddy asks Quinn about the problems she had with meeting her quota and says that Vinny doesn't seem to have trouble with his customers, to which Quinn replies that Vinny sells to different people. Quinn asks Buddy to add an "8-ball" of cocaine to her next order, which surprises Buddy because Quinn hasn't previously wanted to sell cocaine. He tells her that Mick will add it to her order. As Quinn walks out of the den she gets mugged by her follower who hits her face and steals the package with the money she got. Quinn chases the thief but gives up after seeing a police car at the end of the street.

The protagonist finds Sage sitting out in the rain crying and sits next to her to comfort her. Sage wonders if Chad broke up with her because she couldn't help him with becoming president again. She reveals that her anger issues are a result of her parents not allowing her to express her emotions with them, which causes her to bottle up her anger until she bursts. Sage also says that she gets along with Quinn because Quinn usually understands her on these matters.

Sage leaves and on the way back the protagonist bumps into a bleeding Quinn. He convinces her to come back with him to his room, which Quinn recognizes as Vinny's old room. Quinn picks up a magic 8-ball lying in one of the boxes and observes it, as the ball shows "not a chance" and Quinn drops it. They take care of her wounds and the protagonist tries to dig into what happened and why Quinn is so desperate for money and offers to try and help her with his own money. Quinn gets angry at him for offering that but then kisses him and they have sex. Quinn leaves immediately after saying that she doesn't stay nights and asks him to not tell anybody what happened to her.

The next day at class Dawe is trying to make a big deal of the Cathy flyers by showing them to people and reminding them that it's the DIKs fault, and Lily slaps him. Mona is sad and Camila tries to cheer her up. Anthony doesn't want to sit next to Dawe anymore and moves next to Ashley.

At lunch, Quinn and Sage are talking about the end of the scavenger hunt party as it is revealed that Quinn was a pledge last year. She discusses doing things differently this time but Sage tells her to stick to her notes. Riona joins the table and is in a good mood. Meanwhile, at Maya and Josy's table, they discuss Josy being friends with prep Lucas as Becky joins their table and starts talking with Josy. Maya reveals that she dislikes Becky and that Becky was in high school with them and is two years older than her, and also attends many of the DIK parties, as Becky ignores Maya and invites Josy to a dorm party that she's organizing.

Jill calls the protagonist to the auditorium to help her practice for her recital and is scared that she's not going to be able to play well with an audience. Quinn tells Riona about being mugged and losing the money. Riona is scared that she's also being followed and expresses doubt about Quinn's plans for expanding the HOTs, telling her that she should kick out Maya before the latter also becomes a problem like Mona, and threatening to leave the business if this goes on. Quinn convinces her that she's not going to be able to finish college on her own and that their partnership is everything she has. Rusty puts the DIK laptop in a safe that only he, Tommy, and the protagonist have access to. Bella comes to help the protagonist organize the old library and they end up having sex. At night Bella is terrified confronting the fact that she has committed adultery.

The next day at the library, Josy, Maya, Jill, and the protagonist study together as Bella tutors Sage in her dissertation. Sage is looking off and thinks she caught a cold. Sally is buying Xanax from Quinn who informs her that the price has temporarily doubled and urges her to get Sally to also start buying her antidepressants from Quinn, as they also reveal that Sally told something to Quinn about her doctor which Quinn is now using to keep her a loyal customer. Wendy asks the protagonist to tell Derek that she wants to talk with him. Bella reveals that she has an assistant named Brian and offers the protagonist to work in the library. The protagonist and Neil text and discuss him coming back home for his birthday. The group joins the nerds for another game of Dungeons & Gremlins.

Jamie learns that his girlfriend Dany isn't pregnant and breaks up with her as he was planning, but as he celebrates that with the DIKs, he is suddenly overcome by feelings of not knowing what he's going to do now and starts crying. The DIKs go to their work in the elderly home. Josy and Maya go to have public sex with the protagonist in a secluded place for their scavenger hunt tasks. In class, Lily asks the protagonist to let her suck his tongue for a scavenger hunt task and accidentally reveals to Derek that she and Ashley had sex with the protagonist in the HOT sauna. Quinn meets Rich who returns her the drugs she sold him at the party and backs down from the cocaine deal, saying he decided not to do it, but will still pay her. Rich reveals that he wanted the drugs because his grandmother passed away and he was feeling very bad. Quinn is angry at him for showing the drugs uncovered in public, warning him that someone might be watching them. Jade finds the protagonist and they sneak to have sex, as the protagonist wonders why this time she's much less discreet than the previous time.

The protagonist goes back home to celebrate his nineteenth birthday with Neil. Neil remarks that nineteen is an age that has no particular specialty, and then reveals that they got a package from Lynette's family with the protagonist's share in her inheritance, consisting of what is left of her belongings, a check for $5000, and her diary. The protagonist asks why has this arrived now of all times, to which Neil doesn't have an answer. On the way back to college he begins reading the diary, as it tells the story of how Lynette ran away from home because she didn't want to move with her father away from her friends Miranda and Vivian, as she mentions wanting to go with them to the premiere of a movie called "Wings of a Butterfly". At the HOT house, Quinn looks at the bag of cocaine as Maya and Josy come to show the proof of completing their scavenger hunt to Josy's mother Arieth.

At the DIK house, the protagonist is greeted by Tommy who's holding a bag of ice over his groin. The DIKs celebrate the protagonist's birthday and discuss who has and hasn't had sex with Arieth yet and Rusty announces that the prize for winning Hell Week is a one-year pass to the VIP room in The Pink Rose. The DIKs give the protagonist a new phone as a birthday present as a ceiling light falls on the table and Tommy remarks that he must have not tightened the screws enough back when he installed the lights. The protagonist goes to sleep as one of the lights in the yard outside his room flickers and a shadowy figure walks by.

The next day, in a discussion between the protagonist and Nick, it is revealed that Nick's room wasn't damaged during the assault. Nick asks the protagonist not to talk about it with the others to not rub it in. Sage is in bed after catching a cold. Josy and Maya tell the protagonist that they tricked Quinn by showing the evidence to Arieth, as Josy reveals that she kicked Tommy in the balls as revenge for him hitting the protagonist. The protagonist finds Derek's list of girls he wants or has wanted to sleep with. It seems to start from girls he knew from high school: family members of someone called Warren, a deceased Mrs. Deborah, Christine, Olivia, Becky, and Lynn. It proceeds to girls he met in B&R: Cathy, Ashley, Jade, Arieth, Camila, Brandi, Claire, Kylie, and Penny. Jill comes to pick up the protagonist for a surprise birthday picnic in a pasture near the house she grew up in. The picnic goes well but then Jill reveals that they can't meet anymore because Tybalt required her to stop seeing the protagonist if she doesn't want him to press charges.

Back at the protagonist's room in the DIK house, Derek confesses that he wants Ashley but she was hurt when she saw him have sex with Wendy at the hell week party and now she doesn't want to talk with him anymore. Tommy offers to make it up to the protagonist for their bad times by taking him out to the MacAllen bar using a fake ID.

The HOTs are having their scavenger hunt evaluation and Quinn is baffled to hear that Maya completed her list as she was counting on her failing it.

At the MacAllen bar, Tommy and the protagonist meet Nicole and her friend Sandy, who are eager to take off with the protagonist to Nicole's house to have a threesome as Tommy meets with his favorite stripper Tania. On another table at the bar are Jade and Cathy. A drunk and broken Cathy apologizes to Jade about canceling with her on the night of the ANO party when she went to Bella's house, saying she didn't know (that Jade and Bella have a feud, or that Stephen has a thing for Bella) before she went there. Cathy says Jade hates her as Jade says she's only upset, that it doesn't matter now, and that she's her best friend. The protagonist also meets Nora at the bar and has sex with her in the bathroom.

Back at the HOT house, Maya talks with Mona about the free tuition and Mona tells her it doesn't exist. Maya invites Quinn to the discussion but Quinn also says it's just a rumor, denying that she talked about it in the HOT pool with them. Maya slaps Quinn and runs out crying. The protagonist and Josy comfort Maya and the protagonist asks her to tell him why she needs that free tuition. Maya reveals that her father made her sign a student loan she can't afford and is now threatening to stop paying it if she continues to see Josy.

Mona is seen leaving campus with her luggage.

In his office, Prof. Stephen is seen deleting Mona's application for a scholarship from "Wallace Funds", as Cathy's resignation letter is laid out on his desk. He then watches the video of the protagonist having sex with Jade.

Maya's father is seen entering her dorm for a surprise visit using a key that he has. He waits in the empty dorm.
