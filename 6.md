title: Episode 6 - Damage Control
---

At a drug den, Rox and Buddy, two gangsters, talk and do cocaine as a woman lies passed out next to them. The flashback is then viewed from the first-person perspective of someone who Rox affectionately calls "Q" as she enters the room and he tells her to get back to bed, asking the passed-out woman why didn't she tuck her in. It is seen that Rox has a face painting identical to the one that Quinn has.

Back at college, flyers of Cathy's naked photo are being spread as Cathy and Rusty go to the counselor's office.

At the HOT house, Quinn wants to talk privately with Mona and Camila about Mona's change of heart, as Lily reveals to Quinn that she knows about Quinn's prostitution business and joins the discussion. Mona explains that she was disgusted by the person whom she had to service and just couldn't do it. She begs Quinn to let her out of the deal and promises not to tell anyone about this or the drug business, revealing to Lily that Quinn also deals in drugs. Quinn is furious and kicks out Lily and Camila. Quinn is worried that Mona knows too much. She reveals that Prof. Stephen was the client Mona didn't service and threatens to use that information to frame Mona of sex solicitation and have her expelled if she doesn't keep her mouth shut. Outside, Lily reveals that she was eavesdropping on the blackmail conversation to the dismay of Quinn. Lily inquires Quinn about the drug business but Quinn refuses to talk with her.

A flashback shows Vinny, Nick, and Rusty beginning the DIK tradition of the "Walk of Shame", where they cheer and sing as women who slept with DIK members leave the mansion in the morning.

Rusty applauds the protagonist again for showing leadership when even he didn't know what to do, as the funds from his dad have been depleted and he is not likely to get more from him. He gives him the library to live in and tells him to try and talk to Tommy to sort out their feud. Maya and Josy contemplate cheating on their remaining scavenger hunt tasks. The protagonist goes to talk to Tommy and finds him in his room bitter and angry, sitting on the floor and drinking. The conversation heats up as the protagonist blames Tommy for not being there when the DIKs need him and for not having been there as his maggot father when he needed him. Tommy flashes back to a time when Vinny made similar accusations at him and in his rage punches the protagonist.

The protagonist and Tommy laugh and make up. They discuss the recent fights between the DIKs and the jocks. The protagonist mentions that the jocks seem to have shown restraint until the DIKs assaulted their house and that it's peculiar that they would go for such a risky move now given how much they are in trouble due to Chad. Tommy is angry at Quinn and says that they shouldn't party with the HOTs anymore. The protagonist tries to convince him to take part in the work to restore the mansion but Tommy stays in his room.

Tybalt invites Jill for a talk and tells her that they are about to press charges against the protagonist for the damage done at the party. Jill begs him not to do that and he agrees, conditional on Jill complying with certain requirements.

The protagonist moves into the old library. Nick reveals that Tommy hated Vinny and that until Vinny dropped out they were always fighting over power. Tybalt begins being harassed on social media by a user named "Tyballs" who pretends to be him and mocks him.

Rusty gets out of the discussion with Cathy and reveals that after hearing what she's been through he cried, calling the DIK secret code on the event. He also reveals that Cathy believes that it's not the DIKs who leaked her photos, letting them go without punishment.

In Sage's room, Chad breaks up with Sage. Sage is furious and hits him. Sarah, Melanie, and Elena hear the shouts and rush into her room to see the fight unfolding.

Rusty reveals that he found an easy job for the DIKs: accompanying lonely elderly folks at the nearby elderly home. Tommy doesn't like the proposal and goes off to find a better job. Sage calls the protagonist and tells him what happened with Chad.

Quinn goes to the drug den to meet Buddy as she is unaware that she's being followed by someone. At the den, an unnamed elderly woman passes by and shoves her out of the way. Buddy scolds Quinn for dressing suspiciously and goes to fetch her payment. Buddy is surprised that the elderly woman doesn't recognize Quinn anymore even given her face paint. Quinn says that it's not for her but for "him", to which Buddy replies that Quinn was always daddy's girl. Buddy asks Quinn about the problems she had with meeting her quota and says that Vinny doesn't seem to have trouble with his customers, to which Quinn replies that Vinny sells to different people. Quinn asks Buddy to add an "8-ball" of cocaine to her next order, which surprises Buddy because Quinn hasn't previously wanted to sell cocaine. As Quinn walks out of the den she gets mugged by her follower who hits her face and steals the package with the money she got.

The protagonist finds Sage sitting out in the rain crying and sits next to her to comfort her. Sage wonders if Chad broke up with her because she couldn't help him with becoming president again. She reveals that her anger issues are a result of her parents not allowing her to express her emotions with them, which causes her to bottle up her anger until she bursts. Sage also says that she gets along with Quinn because Quinn usually understands her on these matters.

Sage leaves and on the way back the protagonist bumps into a bleeding Quinn. He convinces her to come back with him to his room, which Quinn recognizes as Vinny's old room. Quinn picks up a magic 8-ball lying in one of the boxes and observes it, as the ball shows "not a chance" and Quinn drops it. They take care of her wounds and as the protagonist tries to dig into what happened and why Quinn is so desperate for money, Quinn gets angry at him but then kisses him and they have sex. Quinn leaves immediately after saying that she doesn't stay nights.

The next day at class Dawe is trying to make a big deal of the Cathy flyers by showing them to people and reminding them that it's the DIKs fault. Anthony doesn't want to sit next to Dawe anymore and moves next to Ashley. Jill calls the protagonist to the auditorium to help her practice for her recital and is scared that she's not going to be able to play well with an audience. Quinn tells Riona about being mugged and losing the money. Riona is scared that she's also being followed and expresses doubt about Quinn's plans for expanding the HOTs, threatening to leave the business if this goes on. Quinn convinces her that she's not going to be able to finish college on her own and that Quinn is everything she has. Rusty puts the DIK laptop in a safe that only he, Tommy, and the protagonist have access to. Bella comes to help the protagonist organize the old library and they end up having sex. At night Bella is terrified confronting the fact that she has committed adultery.

The next day at the library, Josy, Maya, Jill, and the protagonist study together as Bella tutors Sage in her dissertation. Sally is seen buying Xanax from Quinn, who doubles the price in an attempt to fix her current situation. The group joins the nerds for another game of Dungeons & Gremlins. Jamie learns that his girlfriend Dany isn't pregnant and breaks up with her as he was planning. The DIKs go to their work in the elderly home. Josy and Maya go to have public sex with the protagonist in a secluded place for their scavenger hunt tasks. Quinn meets Rich who returns her the drugs she sold him at the party and backs down from the cocaine deal, saying he decided not to do it, but will still pay her. Jade finds the protagonist and they sneak to have sex, as the protagonist wonders why this time she's much less discreet than the previous time.

The protagonist goes back home to celebrate his nineteenth birthday with Neil. Neil reveals that they got a package with what is left of his mother's belongings, including a check for $5000 and her diary. The protagonist asks why has this arrived now of all times, to which Neil doesn't have an answer. On the way back to college he begins reading the diary, as it tells the story of how Lynette ran away from home because she didn't want to move with her father away from her friends Miranda and Vivian. At the HOT house, Quinn looks at the bag of cocaine as Maya and Josy come to show the proof of completing their scavenger hunt to Josy's mother Arieth.

At the DIK house, the DIKs celebrate the protagonist's birthday and discuss who has and hasn't had sex with Arieth yet. In a discussion between the protagonist and Nick, it is revealed that Nick's room wasn't damaged during the assault. Nick asks the protagonist not to talk about it with the others to not rub it in. Sage is in bed after catching a cold. Jill comes to pick up the protagonist for a surprise birthday picnic in a pasture near the house she grew up in. The picnic goes well but then Jill reveals that they can't meet anymore because Tybalt required her to stop seeing the protagonist if she doesn't want him to press charges.

At the DIK house, Derek confesses that he wants Ashley but she was hurt when she saw him have sex with Wendy at the hell week party and now she doesn't want to talk with him anymore. Tommy offers to make it up to the protagonist for their bad times by taking him out to the MacAllen bar using a fake ID.

The HOTs are having their scavenger hunt evaluation and Quinn is baffled to hear that Maya completed her list as she was counting on her failing it.

At the MacAllen bar, Tommy and the protagonist meet Nicole and her friend Sandy, who are eager to take off with the protagonist to Nicole's house to have a threesome as Tommy meets with his favorite stripper Tania. On another table at the bar are Jade and Cathy. A drunk and broken Cathy apologizes to Jade about canceling with her on the night of the ANO party when she went to Bella's house, saying she didn't know (that Jade and Bella have a feud, or that Stephen has a thing for Bella) before she went there. Cathy says Jade hates her as Jade says she's only upset, that it doesn't matter now, and that she's her best friend.

Back at the HOT house, Maya talks with Mona about the free tuition and Mona tells her it doesn't exist. Maya invites Quinn to the discussion but Quinn also says it's just a rumor, denying that she talked about it in the HOT pool with them. Maya slaps Quinn and runs out crying. The protagonist and Josy comfort Maya and the protagonist asks her to tell him why she needs that free tuition. Maya reveals that her father made her sign a student loan she can't afford and is now threatening to stop paying it if she continues to see Josy.

In his office, Prof. Stephen is seen deleting Mona's application for a scholarship, as Cathy's resignation letter is laid out on his desk. He then watches the video of the protagonist having sex with Jade.

Maya's father is seen entering her dorm for a surprise visit using a key that he has. He waits in the empty dorm.
