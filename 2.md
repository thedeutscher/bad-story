title: Episode 2 - Maggot Brothers
---

In his room at the DIK house, Tommy is persuaded by Quinn to inject some drugs that she brought. On the way out he encounters Rusty, who tells him that he doesn't want to be a part of any drug business that Tommy is doing with Quinn and Riona.

The protagonist wakes up in the DIK house tied to a chair, along with Derek and a third student also tied to chairs. As the other DIKs are cheering, Tommy explains that the DIK pledges are called "maggots" and that they will now be tested in a CUM-petition: a competition where the objective is to not ejaculate as HOT girls do sexual things with them. Quinn chooses to be with the protagonist, revealing that she knows about him and Maya. Camila grinds on Derek while Riona is on the third maggot, who quickly ejaculates and is kicked out. The protagonist and Derek thus may continue with the DIKs and are released from their chairs, and they join the party that's going on at the DIK house. Derek is concerned about the protagonist being attracted to his sister Maya, and they explore the mansion and chat with the rest of the party members: DIKs Jacob, Jamie, Leon, Nick, and John Boy, and HOTs Elena, Melanie, Sarah, Arieth, Heather, and Ashley, as well as the campus cafeteria worker who is chatting with Ashley upstairs. Jacob is guarding the entrance to Tommy's room because it's reserved only for DIKs this night, John Boy and Elena reveal that they are a couple and that they have a habit of being in their underwear at parties, and Nick discusses seeing an old friend next week. Leon convinces Jamie to come have a threesome with him and Arieth. The protagonist briefly sees the mansion's huge dining room and the janitor's closet, which contains some paint buckets and a ladder.

Tommy says that he is the protagonist's "maggot father" and Rusty is Derek's, as Quinn, Sage, and Riona present their new HOT pledges including Maya. They send the pledges to perform their pledge ritual which involves making out with a DIK. Quinn reveals that up until now this ritual was done with the jocks, but now they're going to do it with the DIKs, thanks to an agreement she made with Tommy, as Sage is puzzled and questions her about this agreement but Quinn shrugs it off. Maya is uncomfortable and approaches the protagonist to make out with him, but Quinn interrupts and tells Maya that she needs to make out with a real DIK and not a pledge when suddenly the DIK house is assaulted by the Tri-Alpha jocks who are angry that the HOTs are partying with the DIKs and not with them. They break the windows by throwing dildos and the party ends as the girls run away. Chad calls Sage out and she joins him, angry at him for making so much trouble, as Chad is angry to see that the protagonist has been near Sage again. The jocks threaten to cause more substantial damage the next time.

The DIKs explain that there has been a war between the DIKs and the jocks ever since Tommy had sex with Dawe's girlfriend Arieth about a year ago, and the jocks beat up Tommy in return. During the flashback, Troy is seen together with the jocks. Rusty talks compassionately with the protagonist and calms his anger over all that happened between him and the DIKs up until now, but says that he knows nothing about the taser and that they only asked the HOTs to bring him over. Rusty reveals that Derek already called dibs on the janitor's closet to be his room when they become DIKs, but that there is an old library that might be suitable as the protagonist's room. Tommy lets the protagonist know that he will be tested in "Hell Week", which includes various difficult tasks, and Rusty reveals that Jacob got arrested during one of his hell week tasks which caused him to be very angry at the DIKs for a while, although he now agrees that it was worth it to join the DIKs.

As Derek and the protagonist walk back to their dorms, Derek discusses wanting to take revenge against Quinn for stealing their clothes. He suggests waiting for a perfect opportunity to steal her clothes but has no idea how to make that happen.

Back in Maya's dorm, Maya is depressed. She reveals to the protagonist that Quinn ordered her to wake him up the way she did, and that Quinn was standing beside and watching them and then used the taser on him. She also reveals that she is the only HOT pledge of the bunch who was made to do such a thing, implying that Quinn is being mean to her on purpose. The protagonist realizes that the "free tuition" Quinn promises to the pledges has something to do with the prostitution business at Quinn's restaurant. He tells her to not trust Quinn and Maya mentions again that she has some problems with her father.

In the morning, the protagonist and Derek are woken up by Tommy and Rusty for some DIK pledge missions. Rusty talks to Tommy about a girl he used to date called Joanne as they send the maggots to infiltrate the ANO mansion and prank Tybalt. The two get to Tybalt's room and take some photos, make a mess and steal his moose trophy, then run away as they are almost caught by the guards. It is revealed that Tybalt is obsessed with Jill as Derek and the protagonist see him sniffing her panties which he stole from her room. Tybalt lies to Jill about what happened, telling her that her panties were stolen by the burglars and that they stole his wallet with thousands of dollars, that he fended the burglars off with his fists, and that he is trying to protect her.

At night time the protagonist and Derek go to another party at the DIK house. They do shots from Sarah's and Melanie's bodies and Jacob is seen making out with Arieth. Derek reveals that he also wants to have sex with Arieth that night as a drunk Sage hits on the protagonist. Tommy is proud to see the protagonist making out with Sage and discusses it with Jacob, who seems more worried but agrees that the DIKs will lend their support to the protagonist if the jocks retaliate against him. Sage pushes the protagonist to have sex with her and shows complete disregard for Chad when the protagonist asks her about him. They almost have sex in the middle of the party but are stopped by Jacob who is still worried that the information about them having had sex in public would be spread by everyone in the party and quickly reach too many people at the campus, including Chad. Back at Maya's dorm, the protagonist and Maya do some more bonding and cuddle but Maya has trouble with her mixed feelings towards him. The next morning, the protagonist gets ready to leave for the weekend and his date with Josy.

Back at the mini-mart in his hometown, the protagonist meets a crying Steve who reveals that his parents are getting divorced because his dad cheated on his mom and that he has to quit his job at the store because he chose to be with his mom. The protagonist meets Josy at her house for their dinner date. They discuss her family and it is revealed that her stepbrother in B&R is Tommy, as she reveals that she hates him, that he used to cheat in his exams in high school, and that he once stole her nail polish to sniff and get high with. Josy is depressed that she still hasn't gotten accepted to B&R, saying she has to move away since she doesn't want to live with her dad and his new wife Monica anymore. They discuss Josy's existing relationship again and that Josy is not happy with it, and end up having sex which is cut short when Josy's dad and Monica get back home early.

Back at college in Maya's dorm, the protagonist tells Maya about the date he had on the weekend and his conflicted feelings, but Maya has to go as Sage calls the protagonist and orders him to come to the gym to help her spy on Chad, as she's lurking in the bushes next to the gym with binoculars and sees Chad leaving the workout area to take a phone call. The protagonist enters the gym and walks towards the locker rooms as the jocks discuss Chad having left to talk on the phone with someone who they assume is Sage. The protagonist sees plenty of Tri-Alpha flags and banners hanging in the hallway and wonders why the gym carries the Tri-Alpha's branding. In the Tri-Alpha exclusive locker room, the protagonist gets video evidence of Chad having an erotic conversation with someone on the phone whom he tells to wear the panties that he brought them. The jocks catch the protagonist on his way out of the locker room but he escapes as Chad gets out and hears from the jocks that the protagonist was in their locker room, and becomes worried now realizing that the protagonist heard his call. The protagonist goes to Sage's room to show her the video proof, and Sage is hurt and wants to find out with whom is Chad cheating on her. The protagonist cheers her up by teaching her sparring, and Sage teaches him that fraternities and sororities have codes, some of which are public codes and some secret codes. The HOTs' public code is "don't turn on each other" and the DIKs' public code is "family comes first". Sage reveals that she wants to learn to play guitar and that's why Chad gave her the protagonist's guitar that the jocks stole from his dorm. The protagonist agrees to be her guitar teacher.

The protagonist runs into Jill and Bella doing yoga. He joins them and when Bella takes a break he talks with Jill until Tybalt comes around and convinces Jill to go off with him to talk about some initiative that Jill is trying to start. Bella returns and reveals that she hates Tybalt and that she's protecting Jill who is a dear friend to her, to the surprise of the protagonist who tells her that she and Jill are very different but Bella disagrees. She expresses her dislike of the protagonist hanging out with Jill but agrees to go out with him once this evening to let him convince her that he's not a bad prospect for Jill. However, as he returns to his dorm Tommy is waiting there and drags him to the DIK house where they make him and Derek chug beer until they are extremely drunk, as punishment for going home on the first weekend and not attending their party. As he and Derek lay on a couch, Derek suddenly exclaims that he got it but loses his train of thought and then asks the protagonist to bring him pasta from the restaurant where he's going to meet Bella.

The protagonist arrives late and drunk to his date with Bella and can barely stand as Bella initially walks away from the date but then returns and takes him in her car back to her home so he can rest until he's sober. The protagonist wanders around in Bella's house and notices tilted furniture, plenty of photo stands that are flipped down, and a soldier mannequin. When he tries to open a certain locked door an angry Bella arrives and directs him to the couch. In the middle of the night, he wakes up, now only mildly drunk, and starts explaining to Bella what happened before suddenly kissing her. Bella is initially angry but then gives in and they make out a bit until she stops him and reveals that she's married.

Alone in her bed Bella feels guilty about the make-out session and reveals that she has not felt sexual urges for three years until now, as she touches herself to sleep thinking of the protagonist.

The next morning Bella gives the protagonist a ride back to college. In class, he talks with Maya and tells her about his mother. They talk about her being worried about Derek cheating all the time and he shows Maya that she and Derek are not that different, since she's also willing to do shady things to pledge the HOTs. Back at Sage's room, the protagonist begins teaching her to play the guitar and they end up having sex, with Quinn coming in and seeing them. Back in class, the Gender Studies teacher Jade flirts with the protagonist.

The protagonist walks in on Jill playing the piano in the auditorium and applauds her, and they chat about music but Jill acts anxious due to her having been watched playing.

At the DIK mansion, Tommy and the DIKs announce the start of "Hell Week" and present the maggots the "devil's pledge board", a board with tasks they must complete during Hell Week to pledge the DIKs.
