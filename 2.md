title: Episode 2 - Maggot Brothers
---

In his room at the DIK house, Tommy is persuaded by Quinn to inject some drug that she brought. On the way out he encounters Rusty, who tells him that he doesn't want to be a part of any drug business that Tommy is doing with Quinn and Riona.

The protagonist wakes up in the DIK house tied to a chair, along with Derek and a third student also tied to chairs. As the other DIKs are cheering, Tommy explains that the DIK pledges are called "maggots" and that they will now be tested in a CUM-petition: a competition where the objective is to not ejaculate as HOT girls do sexual things with them. Quinn chooses to be with the protagonist, revealing that she knows about him and Maya. Camila grinds on Derek while Riona is on the third maggot, who quickly ejaculates and is kicked out. The protagonist and Derek thus may continue with the DIKs and are released from their chairs, and they join the party that's going on at the DIKs house. Derek is concerned about the protagonist being attracted to his sister Maya, and they meet and chat the rest of the party members: DIKs Rusty, Jacob, Jamie, Leon, Nick, John Boy and his girlfriend Elena, and HOTs Melanie, Sarah, Arieth and Heather.

Tommy says that he is the protagonist's "maggot father" and Rusty is Derek's, as Quinn, Sage and Riona present their new HOT pledges including Maya. They send the pledges to perform their pledge ritual which involves making out with a DIK. Maya is uncomfortable and approaches the protagonist to make out with him, but Quinn interrupts and tells Maya that she needs to make out with a real DIK and not a pledge, when suddenly the DIK house is assaulted by the Tri-Alpha jocks who are angry that the HOTs are partying with the DIKs and not with them. They break the windows and the party ends.

The DIKs explain that there is a war between the DIKs and the jocks ever since Tommy had sex with Dawe's girlfriend Arieth. Rusty talks compassionately with the protagonist and calms his anger over all that happened between him and the DIKs up until now, but says that he knows nothing about the taser and that they only asked the HOTs to bring him over.

Back in Maya's dorm, Maya is depressed. She reveals to the protagonist that Quinn ordered her to wake him up the way she did, and that Quinn was standing beside and watching them and then used the taser on him. She also reveals that she is the only HOT pledge of the bunch who was made to do such a thing, implying that Quinn is being mean to her on purpose. The protagonist realizes that the "free tuition" Quinn promises pledges has something to do with the prostitution business at Quinn's restaurant. He tells her to not trust Quinn and Maya mentions again that she has some problems with her father.

In the morning, the protagonist and Derek are woken up by Tommy and Rusty for some DIK pledge missions. They send them to infiltrate the ANO mansion and prank Tybalt. The two get to Tybalt's room and take some photos, make a mess and steal his moose trophy, then run away as they are almost caught by the guards. It is revealed that Tybalt is obsessed with Jill and sniffs stolen pairs of her panties, as he lies to her about what really happened during the break-in.

At night time the protagonist and Derek go to another party at the DIK house. They do shots from Sarah's and Melanie's bodies and Sage hits on the protagonist. They almost have sex in public but are stopped by Jacob who fears the repercussions of Chad getting to know of this. Back at Maya's dorm, the protagonist and Maya do some more bonding and cuddle but Maya has trouble with her mixed feelings towards him. The next morning, the protagonist gets ready to leave for the weekend and for his date with Josy.

Back at the mini-mart at his hometown, the protagonist meets a crying Steve who reveals that his parents are getting divorced and that he has to quit his job at the store. The protagonist meets Josy at her house for their dinner date. They discuss her family and it is revealed that her stepbrother in B&R is none other than Tommy. Josy is depressed that she still didn't get accepted to B&R, saying she has to move away since she doesn't want to live with her dad and his new wife Monica anymore. They discuss Josy's existing relationship again and that Josy is not happy with it, and end up having sex which is cut short when Josy's dad and Monica get back home early.

Back at college in Maya's dorm, the protagonist tells Maya about the date he had on the weekend and his conflicted feelings, buy Maya has to go as Sage calls the protagonist and orders him to come to the gym to help her spy on Chad. At the gym locker room, the protagonist gets video evidence of Chad doing dirty talk with someone on the phone. The jocks catch him on his way out of the locker room but he escapes and goes to Sage's room to show her the video proof. Sage is hurt but he cheers her up by teaching her sparring, and Sage teaches him that fraternities and sororities have "codes": each one has a public code and a secret code. The HOTs public code is "don't turn on each other" and the DIKs public code is "family comes first". Sage reveals that she wants to learn to play guitar and that's why Chad gave her the protagonist's guitar that the jocks stole from his dorm. The protagonist agrees to be her guitar teacher.

The protagonist runs into Jill and Bella doing yoga. He joins them and when Bella takes a break he talks with Jill until Tybalt comes around and convinces Jill to go off with him. Bella returns and reveals that she hates Tybalt and that she's protecting Jill who is a dear friend to her. She expresses her dislike to the protagonist hanging out with Jill but agrees to go out with him once this evening to let him convince her that he's not a bad prospect for Jill. However, as he returns to his dorm Tommy is waiting there and drags him to the DIK house where they make him and Derek chug beer until they are extremely drunk.

The protagonist arrives late and drunk to his date with Bella and can barely stand as Bella initially walks away from the date but then returns and takes him in her car back to her home so he can rest until he's sober. The protagonist wanders around in Bella's house but when he tries to open a certain locked door an angry Bella arrives and directs him to the couch. In the middle of the night he wakes up, now only mildly drunk, and starts explaining to Bella what happened before suddenly kissing her. Bella is initially angry but then gives in and they make out a bit until she stops him and reveals that she's married.

Alone in her bed Bella feels guilty about the make out session and reveals that she has not felt sexual urges for three years until now, as she touches herself to sleep thinking of the protagonist.

The next morning Bella gives the protagonist a ride back to college. In class he talks with Maya and tells her about his mother. Back at Sage's room, the protagonist begins teaching her to play the guitar and they end up having sex, with Quinn coming in and seeing them. Back in class the Gender Studies teacher Jade flirts with the protagonist.

The protagonist walks in on Jill playing the piano in the auditorium and applauds her, and they chat about music although she feels embarrassed having been watched playing.

At the DIK mansion Tommy and the DIKs announce the start "Hell Week" and present the maggots the "devil's pledge board", a board with tasks they must complete during Hell Week in order to pledge the DIKs.

At the Tri-Alpha house Chad receives a blackmail message from someone claiming to know his secret, and immediately suspects the protagonist.
